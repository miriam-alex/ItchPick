            "Thank you so much for the kind words and detailed response I definitely agree that having a better indication of limited vs unlimited actions would be useful though Im unsure how Id do that without making the action buttons larger to fit a donemax counter An icon or different colour would work but people still have to learn what it means in the first place Ill throw a note on the list to think about for ifwhen I work on a content update I had intended to make tooltips for the skills which wouldve broken down your current multipliers but ran out of time for my selfimposed deadline I may be able to fit them into the bugfix patch Ill do in the next few days That combined with the postloop breakdown screen should clear things up Added note to tweak the Force Ground Floor Door action in the bugfix It was only actually hidden initially due to a technical limitation which I then fixed for the Admin Door I have a few plans for the Action and Inventory panels but theyll all likely have to wait for the content update Currently items are consumed in order of how much they restore which honestly is just a holdover from Increlution but Terraformental has increasingly become a slightly different style of game so you may be right that it should change Yeah Ill try to fit this into the bugfix It can be difficult to decide how much to fit into a single log message as I didnt want to have a single message scrolling off the screen or generally put people off reading them But you do raise a good point that I could add extra Explore more carefully actions once you have access to all the unlimited resources and are stabilised As you say harvesting when full would be very exploitable for farming XP The closest Id consider is if your inventory is full but youre missing enough of the resource that you could instantly consume it then maaaaybe But Id want to build up more of the game so I have a better idea of what impact that might have on balance before I made that kind of change I can definitely add a disable other actions warning of some kind on some actions but itd likely be in the content update Thanks for the offer  Ill be sure to keep you in mind if I get around to doing beta tests Though if Im honest I doubt Ill get it to the front page as nice as that would be xD",

            "Great demo  Want to point out that there is exploit for some of XP in current version coming from the fact that attempting to start harvesting action for 55 items still advances time by small amount So with enough amount of clicking it eventually reaches the point when item is being consumed and harvesting starts",
            "Ooo very nice catch Thanks Ill add a ticket to fix that in v02",
            "Only just noticed this creative feature got pointed out yes I knew of itIf you are going to get rid of it id suggest again to consider a collecting whilst full mechanicIt felt annoying enough to do that people wouldnt try to farm it not casually at least but it was also a really really useful tool if you were like 002 units away from being able to harvest and consume another resource without some other action to queue used it a fair bit to top up water as much as possible before setting out and with the collection times being so fast anyway it was not worthwhile to farm xp from itWhen theres no leaderboard and if it breaks anything it would only be breaking for themselves I think its definitely something that could be accidentally overlooked if there wont be a different mechanic to fill the holeAlternate fixes would probably be too complex to be worth the dev time for nowThought I should say something before it gets patched and makes it all even harder without purpose",
            "That is a fair observation Id certainly be happy to allow completing a pickup action to 99 even when youre full But I feel allowing actually picking items up when youre full would cause people to accidentally pick things up without realising theyre fullI suppose if it was REALLY wanted then Id consider adding a button which lets you consume an item early so long as you have space for at least 90 of it or something Maybe have a toggle option to automatically do it when youre trying to pick up another of that item Ill add it to the maybe list for v02 but it may be up being pushed back to a later version depending how long things take Im going to try and stick to a similar schedule of working on major updates for 2 weeks then release it rather than end up feature creeping",
            "This is really good It was nice to try and figure out how to manage the resources to do everything on time I managed to reach the end of the demo after 3 loops Thank you and I hope youll continue developing this ",
            "Absolutely love itBe cool if actions been sorted by group like foodwaterair refill deconstruction movement",
            "ThanksI had planned to do groupings on the inventory in V020 but doing the same to actions would make sense so long as I can make decent new actions available indicators Its already hard to tell sometimes",
            "You can hl new actions just with flag and hover to clear it Like factorio new recipes For me its far more comfortable than any animations and easily to do",
            "Yeah thatd be my goto My only concern is when new actions are added to the bottom of the list but youre scrolled to the top Ill play around with some UIs when I get there and see what works",
            "May be add new actions counter I thought its simplest solution May be isnt so elegant but useful  Especially in games where old actions dont disappear but still moved to archive part",
            "Oooh yes That works Just a little indicator on the Actions title for X new so long as there are any Thanks",
            "Even just keeping the highlight until its been moused over  but it doesnt seem like a particular issue when mistakes and looking around how to do things better is part of the game anyway",
            "This is very well put together and you did a great job of making a puzzle out of the timing  Id love to see more of it  I think the only thing Id really like to see in terms of quality of life is some kind of postloop breakdown so I can know exactly how my skills translated into the permanent upgrades  Aside from that yeah this was a lot of fun and I look forward to updates",
            "Thank you for the kind wordsI did have plans for a postloop breakdown but ended up pushing it back to v020 Other than a bugfix update in the next few days I plan to take a break by working on a different game for a short time before I decede whether or not to start on a content update for this Really glad you enjoyed it though",
            "Neat game Seems pretty interesting so far  I got back to the derelict ship for the second life but you probably shouldnt have the option to skip the derelict ship still available once you arrive at itAlso its pretty easy to softlock yourself in the first run by removing the food coupler before you finish fixing the ship at which point you have to start over from the beginning because you wont have the food to get to the ship Overall a fun game though Ill be excited to see it become a full game if you continue working on it",
            "Thanks for finding that bug with skipping the derelict  the requirements for when the actions dodont appear get pretty tangled at times so its easy to miss edge cases like that Ive added it to a list for a bugfix update that Ill aim to do in the next few daysUnsure if Ill change the food coupler though I do want it to be entirely possible for people to lose their first run if theyre not paying attention but the food coupler may be an overly punishing one Ill have to think on itThanks for your comment"

        "description": "Ive been working on this off  on for a few years The main idea of the game is to be a large true open world adventure with unique quests with different ways of completing them   What do I mean by true open world Anywhere that you see on the map can be explored You see a forest You can go in there You see a mountain You can explore it I try to keep the map as open and explorable as possible   For the quests I want them to have different ways of completing them depending on factors like statsparty membersitems how the quest was startedetc The quests dont take into consideration all of that stuff at once but usually one or two of them   Some features of the game right now include   5 races  8 Starting classes to choose from 24  companions to recruit and join you VisuStella FTB Combat FTB AKA Free Turn Battle means you get a pool of actions and you can choose which member uses them 2 cities and a small town 6 forests 5 dungeons 7 small replayable dungeons Each class has unlockable skills as they level up Each class has access to 4 weapons that can be upgraded to a 5 16 more that can only be upgraded to 1 an assortment of accessories Not much in the way of armor right now Several items in the form of potions bombs and materials 5 marked quest from the Adventurers Guild  5 untracked quests on the map several more secret areas that I wouldnt consider quests Id say at least a few hours of gameplay   I dont plan to make the game story focused and prefer a more soulslike approach where the story and world building are through environment and item descriptions Not that there wont be  a story for the game but I prefer to keep it light I personally hate how much reading and cutscenes there are in JRPGs and RPGs in general because they always seem to drag on and I start losing interest real fast and just start skipping it all Ideally any interactions in my game that happen will be no more than a minute or two to get through    While the game is in early alpha it doesnt mean  there isnt much in the game right now  It just means that compared to what the full game will be this is basically just a taste of what to expect   The core mechanics and gameplay are somewhat there  Things change and get added as I get ideas but the main idea of what the game IS is there   Why release it now  Well its in a playable state and Id like to get feedback on what others think about it Plus It keeps me motivated to see interest in the project   What about the future of this game  Im going to keep working on it for the foreseeable future after all Im really only scratching the surface for what I want this game to be  Theres currently two quests that are partially complete that arent in the game I need to finish those up and Ive got at least 2 more classes that I want to add to the game when the balance is in a better place  Ill keep working on it as long as theres an interest in it   Will I start charging for the game Whats the financial model   Its my belief that incomplete games shouldnt be charged for I remember back in the day when a game was complete when you bought it and so I wont be charging anything for this until its complete At least until theres a full bug free experience to be had The earliest I would start charging anything would be when I completely finish the Aquanis area the region of the map that the playable area takes place in and even then it would only be a couple bucks  But any donations are greatly appreciated it lets me know you really believe in the project   How buggy is the game right now   Well I cant say its bug free or without its problems The combat balance is an on going process with the game  There always seems to be something that comes up with random softlocks or things not working properly in rare cases I try to take care of these as soon as possible if they are a major issue   I really enjoyed the game  concept how can I help  Honestly Just letting me know what you thought giving suggestions and letting me know of any bugs is enough You can also share the page around wherever you want to promote it The more people that know of it the better Otherwise unless you want make artwork for the game bug test  or provide plugins just showing support is enough to keep me motivated    I really didnt enjoy the game  Well I hope if thats the case youll let me know why I know the game has its issues right now  but I want to make it the best experience that it can be Its gonna take some time to get there  but Im committed to getting it there   The game is too ambitious Are you going to cut back the amount of content  I dont plan on cutting back on my vision for the game thats the problem  I know that the game is going to be incredible when its complete so I cant bare the idea of cutting any of it out  If I can make a game that surprises people with how good it is from the amount of quality content my role as the game developer will be fulfilled and I can be proud to call this my creation    Will saves carry over to future versions  You can move your saves to newer versions and they should be compatible but I cant guarantee it The only problems that would occur would be if a quest softlocked you in this case if you have an older save from before then it might be recoverable if a future quest relied on new code added to old quests that cant be repeated in this case I can just add a way to get whatever was needed or if an old area was reworked and you got stuck in an immovable spot In this case you could use the travel scroll to teleport out of it   How often are you going to release updates  Short answer I dont know If theres a game breaking bug discovered then Ill try to get an update out as soon as possible As far as additions of new content I cant really say I really want to make sure the core gameplay is solid first before going all out with new content  Ill try to get new updates out whenever theyre ready maybe an update every month or two    Summary   Its in early alpha but the main mechanics are there Im releasing it now to get feedback and to motivate me Im pretty sure most of the major gamebreaking bugs are fixed fingers crossed The game will continue to be free until there is a full experience to charge for Love it or hate it Id appreciate the feedback so I can make it better Expect updates to fix game breaking bugs main updates about every month   If you make a video on the game let me know Id love to see it   Discord Server  httpsdiscordggGXHucC4HHC   Copy and paste the link I dont know why the hyperlink wont work   BTW I have no idea if the Mac version works because I dont know anyone with a Mac to test it on and nobody has said it hasnt Please let me know if theres an issue",

arenas del tiempo se mezclan con leyendas de oro y peligro se encuentra Santa Fe en la frontera difusa de Nuevo Mxico Una sombra se cierne sobre las vastas y misteriosas tierras del norte En las entraas oscuras y labernticas de las minas cercanas rumores de extraos sucesos han comenzado una circular mineros desaparecidos ecos inexplicables y sombras que parecen cobrar vida alimentan el miedo y la supersticin de los lugareos   Los rumores sobre antiguas reliquias apaches y leyendas de tesoros ocultos como las mticas diez monedas doradas han avivado las creencias y temores en la regin

        "description": "Future Fronts working title is a custommecha action game built in the Godot Engine in this early playtest copy you can build your mech from a selection of playtest parts and weapons and play through five missions as well as three challenge arena fights Your part choice effects your stats and the handling of your mech   Send feedback to this email address futurefrontsfeedbackgmailcom   THIS IS A VERY EARLY ROUGH BUILD OF THE GAME MEANT ENTIRELY FOR PUBLIC PLAYTESTING AND FEEDBACK IT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT   A tutorial is available ingame but important information for the user interface the control layout and stats can be found at the bottom of this page  Currently controllers are not supported controller support will be offered in the next playtest build  Currently there are no weight or generator capacity limits on your build  so you can freely equip anythinghowever a heavy weight will still make you slower This will change in the next build as well   Not all mechanics are completed or finalized some stats and systems havent been integrated A few of these systems will be designed based on playtest feedback Some of these statssystems are the following   Armor and Resistances   Arm Recoil Reduction   Energy Weapon interactions and Power Distribution System mechanics   Targeting Evasion and Targeting Interference   Extension Modules Maximum weight burdens for arms and legs maximum energy load on generator   Feedback is highly encouraged and valuable for the development of this project below are a list of known issues they will be addressed before the game is complete   The sound is bad Yes it is it is entirely placeholder and will be replaced with custom sounds in the future The Main Menu UI is bad It sure is it is also mostly placeholder If you have specific recommendations for how to change the UI however do send them There isnt enough Melee Melee has been on the backest of backburners currently there is only one melee weapon but there will be many options in the future There should be build saving There will be in the future The head choice doesnt change my stats  Heads are purely asthetic and dont have stats     UI CONTROLS    To enter the customization menu click on the HANGAR button on the main menu Cycle through parts using the buttons on the left side of the screen changes to important stats can be tracked on the right side of the screen and part stats will be displayed anytime a part is changed  To confirm a part change make sure to click the CONFIRM button in the upper left portion of the screen To cancel any changes and revert to the last saved build press CANCEL  To switch to the paint menu click the PAINT MENU button and click it again to switch back to the part selection Similarly there is a CONFIRM and RESET button in the paint menu To switch which part of your mech you are currently painting use the buttons on the left side of the menu There is a  SIMPLE  mode which will let you paint either the entirety of your frame or the entirety of your weapons and an  ADVANCED  mode which lets you paint each part seperately The UI is pretty bad looking will be fixed in the eventual UI rework   GAMEPLAY CONTROLS   WASD  Controls movement F  Toggles boosters onoff When boosters are off you will fall at a normal rate instead of gliding  Moving with boosters does not consume energy SPACE  Jump and UpwardBoost while in the air LEFTCLICKRIGHTCLICK  Use your equipped left and right hand weapons QE or 12  Use your equipped left and right backmounted weapons IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE A MOUSE BUTTON SETUP FOR THIS R  Action key this has a few different uses If you hold down the action key and use any of your reloadable weapons you will manually reload them If you hold down the action key while moving against a wall and jump you will execute a wall jump C  Overboost toggle SHIFT  Quickboost use this to dodge and dash around   STAT TIPS   Your quickboost has technical properties based on your part stats It has a duration given by your thrusters an impulse time given by your thrusters and a peak time given by your power distribution system During the duration of your quickboost your velocity will approach the maximum speed of your quickboost based on your impulse timethe lower the faster and then stay at that speed based on the peak timethe higher the longer before decreasing back down to your normal speed during the remaining duration   Your power distribution system is a component that applies modifiers to your generator properties and tweaks the performance of other systems currently the PDS only affects thruster and generator stats    Your thrusters have an acceleration value this determines how quickly you reach your maximum traveling speed while moving  This also affects how quickly and snappily you can switch from moving in one direction to the other  Your thruster acceleration will start at its base stat and be reduced based on how heavy your build is You can counteract this reduction with the MANEUVERABILITY stat that is on your frames legs A heavy frame with low maneuverability will feel weightier and require more mindful control   Your targeting system has an ideal range and a range spread It also has an acquisition level and acquisition rate When you lock onto a target your aim will initially not be on them perfectly but it will improve by your acquisition rate over time to a particular level This lock level is improved greatly if you have your target within the range spread of your ideal range There are three playtest targeting systems one for each range  You will know your lock level as your lock box and reticule will turn from white to green and then red when you are above a 90 percent lock quality At higher quality locks your frame will lead its shots",

        "description": "Episode I  The Goddess     2999 AD humanity is exploring space and we are part of the IF or Interplanetary Federation Here we meet Wendicka Lovejoy adopted daughter of admiral John Lovejoy and her surrogate sister Crystal McLeen finishing their training to be officials in METEOR The job every young boy and girl dreams of But it goes horribly wrong and Crystal would have died if an unknown person didnt kidnap her to turn her into a cyborg Both girls retire from their dream job as a result     One year later Wendicka is an engineer working in the maintenance of Excalibur the most important space station of the IF the symbol of the IFs invincibility it was named after King Arthurs sword for a reason Crystal works as a barmaid in a bar within the same station But then the station always believed to be impenetrable gets invaded by Astrilopups an alien race enemies of the IF and mindless cyborgs wearing implants pretty similar to Crystals What is going on Is it connected with how Crystal became a cyborg herself    The answers are out there somewhere in space Can you help the two girls find these answers         Cast   Wendicka Lovejoy Adopted daughter of admiral John Lovejoy Wendicka does not know anything about where she came from Shes a tomboy with a very straightforward and tactless personality and Crystal often comments she shouldnt be so rude Wendicka has the very bad habit to go into a complete panic when things do not go the way she planned She always means well though and is very intelligent and an astounding engineer Her skills with technology bely her age Wendicka suffers from a condition she calls a curse due to lack of a better word causing her to be unable to eat and drink and allowing her to feed on electricity   Crystal McLeen Crystal has been Wendickas friend since she was an infant and the two girls consider each other as sisters Crystal became a cyborg due to an otherwise fatal incident Nobody knows who turned her into a cyborg but whoever did saved her life Crystal is in all sorts of way the calmness contrasting Wendickas tomboyish behavior Although Crystal is a bit naive compared to Wendicka she often acts more mature than her on the moments that count Crystal is a vegetarian   Experimental Human Replica Unit ExHuRU ExHuRU is an android programmed to protect Wendicka much to her displeasure as she doesnt want to be protected As a robot ExHuRU lacks all sorts of emotion and is also unable to comprehend human irrational thoughts Wendicka tries to get rid of him all the time and she often acts extremely rude an offensive towards him although he has no understanding of her rudeness and ignores it as a result    Yirl son of Astrolon In a bar somewhere on a forgotten planet the girls meet Yirl Yirl is a a bounty hunter of the Klargin race who makes a living by doing a lot of dirty jobs and winning peoples money Hes hated by the IF and the people he won from Yirl insists on taking Wendicka under his protection and Wendicka suspects he knows very important stuff   Foxy Firefox Foxy is a carefree Vulpin girl making a living as a thief and prostitute Foxy joins Wendicka and friends for fun out of lust for adventure Foxy is actually a very bright and courageous woman although she never took life too seriously Foxy has a little dragon called Reggie who was born in a laboratory when mad scientists were trying to play god They did manage to create a dragon who is even able to breath fire they only neglected to teach him manners and as a result Foxy has a hard time keeping his rude behavior under control   Xenobi Xenobi is a Ji knight ordered by the grand master to take Wendicka and friends under his protection His devotion to The Power allows him to do many supernatural things think of it as magic if you want Xenobi is falling in love with Crystal from the first moment he laid eyes on her    Rolf van den Broek Rolf is a civilian of the former Dutch planet colony Nizozemska As a result he has a lot of trouble speaking English properly Rolf is a typical nononsense kind of guy who does what he has to do     Other Characters   Sean Briggs Briggs is Wendickas and Crystals commanding officer during their first mission Hes very strict and businesslike   John Lovejoy Wendickas father by adoption and he does not have an easy relationship with his daughter John is a very religious man and Wendicka is an atheist and Wendicka believes that is the reason for the awkward relationship although she never realized that John always said that God have her the freedom to think for herself and to belief what she wants to believe in other words he never oppressed his religion onto her The true reason is that John is overprotective in Wendickas views and shes in fear of getting caged   Admiral Johnson A female admiral This 78years old woman is not a woman to toy around with Shes very extremely strict and shes known for her authority and some people in the IF think of her as an iron lady She does have a softer side though and Wendicka will eventually find out   Reggie Ryuda Foxys companion Created in a laboratory Hes very extremely rude and cracks bad often sexually offensive jokes only to get kicked for it by Foxy Still hes very intelligent and he DOES care for his friends although he gives you a hard time acknowledging that   Banika An alien female traveling merchant who got lost during her travels If you can get her out of her trouble she will eagerly go with you and sell you her wares at a special rate   Sue McLeod Rolfs girlfriend and shes basically everything Rolf is not Like Rolf she lives on Nizozemska and shes a firstrate blabbermouth and always extremely cheerful When she gets mad she really goes berserk only to forget about it in a few minutes carrying on like nothing happens with the same cheerful mood She is a hard worker and allows herself pretty little time for entertainment and rest There is however more about her than you would initially think     Additional links     Video with developers commentary   Game Script source code    ",

            "Cool little game well done I liked the two sections where your actions in game directly translated to that out of the game though having two of those in a 10 minute game might be a little much Also I think the Monster design itself and the scares were a little weak I wouldve preferred a less visable monster leaving more to the imagination the pixel sprite is a perfect representation for the monster already Still pretty enjoyable though",

            "Game is so much fun D Reminded me of my WorldBox worlds when all of the land was occupied by kingdoms So I have a few ideas for the game 1 If you are going to make alliances make them have names or something that identifies them I mean alliances like a group of nations not an alliance of relationship between 2 nations and that when an alliance wins a war against another allience all of the captured land will be shared equally between all of the nations of that alliance 2 Nation traits Like the ideology idea of MewsterGames This will be like the nature of the nations for example Aggresive Peaceful Rich Powerful etc So you can make the nations more unique 3 Tecnologies A tecnology tree that you can see when you see a nations info Nations will be researching more and more over time and some tecnologies only unclock when the world reachs a certain age or era You can also add this for example Stone Age Bronze Age Medieval Age etc It will be cool to have distinct brands on the tech tree and that nations develop their own style for example Army and Economy Colonization and Politics Relationships and Army etc 4 Army raids This could add more use to the Armies tabs basically its that the armies move around the map in big groups It can be sea or land also sea ones could transport land armies and fight each other 5 Distinct types of war There could be different types of roles in wars for example One nation declares war to another that nation is in the role of Attack while the other depending on their traits and the situation could be Defense and hold still until peace or be Fight Back and try to fight back the enemies while conquering their land 6 Recources Not only land resources can make the difference in a war Things like gold food or soldiers will do 7 Trade NationsAlliances can make trade routes and trade resources with other nationsalliances 8 Cities Besides of the capital and the forts this ones would be strategic points for nations and alliances because they will produce gold soldiers and serve as trade points 9 Nations dont disappear when their capital has been taken Okay some will but what I say is There was one nation that has the entire Africa and then poof it disappears because their capital in Madagascar was taken its just too unrealistic You could take the city mechanic I sugested and make that when a nation looses its capital it just switches to another city but with a HUGE penalization Land resources whatever you want 10 Time go slowerfaster Sometimes I would like to slow down time to see what happens with detail and sometimes I just want to go fast foward I dont think that I have to explain this one 11 Slower colonization One single nation that started on a small island colonizated the entire world with insane speeds Maybe you could make that colonization speed depends on size resources and tecnologies of a nation 12 World peace Wars cannot occur just because you need to justify that with something it could be hate alliance or something else Maybe nations that go in several wars become more hated and peaceful ones dont get wars almost never they are more protected and only be attacked by warbased nations its just that world never achieves real peace like our world today maybe in some point of the game you could make this happens To keep the fun in this state nations can still make small wars sometimes or WORLD WARS 13 More player interaction Maybe make the player able to moddify relationships alliances thecnologies resources wars rebelions or basically everything on the game Like a God Mode  I know that what Im asking for is A LOT of work for you but if you could take the time to make this not even all maybe just one or two I would be happy to come back and play with these new features I just want to say that this is an awesome game with an awesome future thank you for reading this 3 PD LONG LIVE TO MINORNIA",
            "Wow now this is something D Thanks for the ideas Some of these I can already see working quite well",
            "Youre welcome And also I think that alliances could have traits defining them and their members and that nations could earn traits over time like a nation that havent been in war for several years earns the peaceful trait Again an awesome game that I expect to be even more awesome  Edit I have read the desing process log and if the armies are one tile they have HP and they lose it when conquering and attacking other armies Or at least thats what I think Could you show this on Armies tab Armies moving and their HP would be something that Id like to keep track on during a war",

            "Thank you so much D One thing I would like to know is how long people usually sit on a single session Do you only watch for 200 years seconds or so and create a new map or does it remain interesting for 1000 years I personally have watched one session for over 2000 years D",
            "my max so far is about 600 years as I must admit it can get a little boring Also the armies tab seems a bit confusing and I recommend explaining how it works ",
            "The Armies tab was mainly for debugging and Im still not sure if it is necessary for players to see basically it shows the entities that do the attacking and defending the border and seeing them might explain why some nation is losing a war As for your ideology comment Ill think about it D for example how it would effect the nations behaviour Again thanks for the feedback",

        "description": "  Lunar  Game Rules   Overview   In Lunar Colonization you  command an alien fleet tasked with the colonization of the Moon Your  mission is to clear difficult lunar regionsobstructed by rugged  terrainusing your scouts Once cleared these regions transform into  Lunar Beacons that serve as strategic waypoints for further exploration  Ultimately you build fullfledged lunar colonies by assembling  complete suit sequences Every card in your deck represents a part of  your invading fleet and each move brings you closer to establishing a  dominant alien presence on the Moon        Setup     Alien Fleet Deck   A standard deck of 52 cards is shuffled This deck represents your alien fleet       Columns Scouting Areas   Four columns are created each representing a lunar region that must be scouted and cleared   Each column is set up as follows   Region Card  Drawn from the deck placed face up at the top of the column This card marks a specific lunar area that requires clearance   Terrain Cards  Three cards are drawn next and placed face down These represent the difficult lunar terrain that must be overcome   Scout Card  One final card is drawn and placed face  up at the bottom of the column This card is your initial scout unit  ready to explore the region         Discard Pile   Starts empty Cards drawn from the fleet are placed here face up       Colony Piles Lunar Colonies   Four foundation piles where you will build colonies They must be built by suit in ascending orderfrom Ace to King       Objective   Your goal is to complete all  four colony piles by transferring cards from the alien fleet and the  scouting columns according to specific movement rules When each colony  pile has 13 cards from Ace through King you win the game        Gameplay Mechanics   1 Drawing from the Alien Fleet     Drawing a Card    Click the deck alien fleet to draw the top card This card is turned face up and placed in the discard pile        Recycling the Fleet    If the fleet runs out of cards a doubleclick on the deck will recycle  the discard pile back into the deck all cards are turned face down in  the process        2 Scouting and Clearing Regions     Region Cards  Terrain   Region Cards  Represent specific lunar areas that require clearance   Terrain Cards  Placed over the region card in each column these represent the difficult terrain that must be cleared       Flipping Terrain Cards    When no playable scout remains in a column the next terrain card  currently face down is flipped to reveal additional scouting  resources Only when all terrain cards in a column are cleared is the  region card unlocked and transformed into a Lunar Beacon        Scouts    Only faceup cards other than locked region cards can be moved Scouts  are used to explore and clear the terrain and can be moved either  individually or as part of a substack that follows the proper sequence        3 Moving Cards Between Columns Scouting Moves     Building Substacks    Cards in a column may be moved together as a substack if they form a  descending sequence in alternating colors This represents your scouts  moving in formation to clear obstacles        Restrictions on Region Cards    A region card is locked in place as long as there is unrevealed  facedown terrain Only once all the terrain is cleared flipped face  up and moved can the region card be shifted When the final Terrain  card is moved the cleared region becomes a Lunar Beacon        DoubleClick Moves    A doubleclick on a card automatically attempts to send that card to a colony if the move follows the rules for quick play        4 Building Lunar Colonies   Colony Piles    These foundation piles are built by suit in ascending order  Starting a Colony  The first card must be an Ace   Subsequent Cards  A card can be added if it is of the same suit as the top card and exactly one rank higher     Objective    Complete all four colonies each must have 13 cards to win the game     5 Additional Controls     Back Button    A blue BACK button allows you to return the top card of the discard pile to the fleet if you need to change your move        Reset Button    Clicking the RESET button restarts the game reshuffling your alien fleet and redealing the scouting columns        Winning the Game   You win Lunar Colonization when  all four colony piles are completeeach colony must have exactly 13  cards built in order from Ace to King        Strategic Tips     Plan Ahead    Consider your moves carefully especially when moving substacks between  columns A misstep might block a potential clearing of a region        Clear Terrain Promptly    Flipping and clearing the difficult terrain facedown cards is key to  unlocking your region cards and turning them into Lunar Beacons        Efficient Fleet Management    Use your discard pile and the back button wisely to cycle through your  alien fleet ensuring you have the right cards available when needed        Quick Moves    Use the doubleclick feature to quickly move cards to your colonies when  the conditions are metthis can save valuable time and prevent clutter  in your scouting areas        Thematic Interpretation     Alien Fleet    Every card in your deck symbolizes a spacecraft or unit from your  invading alien fleet Managing this fleet effectively is crucial to your  success        Regions  Lunar Beacons    The region cards represent untamed areas on the Moon Your scouts must  clear away the rugged uncharted terrain so these regions can be  converted into strategic Lunar Beaconsguiding posts that enable further  colonization        Lunar Colonies    The final destination of your operations Once a region is cleared and  transformed you build a colony there securing your alien foothold on  the Moon     ",

zusammen verziere die Bruchstellen mit goldener Farbe und erflle die manchmal fragwrdigen Wnsche deiner Kunden Aber Vorsicht Nicht jedes Teil passt so perfekt wie du denkst   Steuerung       Maus   Linksklick   Drehen und anpassen    Rechtsklick   markieren   Story  Aus Zeitgrnden nicht implementiert   Intro und Tutorial wird beim Spielbeginn angezeigt   Endlich ist dein Tag gekommen Nach drei Diplomabschlssen einem Doktor im Ingenieurwesen 20 Jahren Berufserfahrung und unzhligen Nebenjobs hast du endlich genug angespart um deinen Traum eines eigenen KintsugiLadens auszuleben       Du kaufst dir eine 20 Quadratmeter Wohnung in der fast nicht existenten Innenstadt des kleinen Dorfes Keramos Hier soll dein Imperium entstehen Die Ausgangslage ist optimal Mit 450 Einwohnern die alle ein Faible fr Keramikobjekte haben und keiner Konkurrenz weit und breit bist du dir sicher schon nchstes Jahr in der Liste der reichsten Menschen aufzutauchen       Mit dem riesigen Kapital dass du angespart hast musstest du keine Kompromisse eingehen Die besten Werkzeuge und Materialien waren schon in deinem Keramazon Warenkorb Die Deko penibel ausgesucht und bereit fr den Import aus Japan Sogar einen KintsugiGromeister mit goldenem Grtel hast du als Mitarbeiter anwerben knnen      Leider hast du dein gesamtes Geld in Kryptowhrung investiert und in deiner alten PCFestplatte aufbewahrt die deine Mutter vor 2 Wochen weggeschmissen hat Dieser winzige Rckschlag hlt dich aber nicht von deinem Vorhaben ab       Letztes Jahr ist dein reicher Grovater verstorben und als einer seiner 32 Enkel durftest du dir was aus seinem Erbe aussuchen Whrend die anderen sich komischerweise um seine Uhren und Autosammlung gestritten haben hast du die wahren Perlen entdeckt Den massiven und robusten Schreibtisch der selbst den zweiten Weltkrieg berlebt hat und das Regal welches all die den Uhren zur Schau stellte Ein Visionr wie du erkennt natrlich den wahren Wert eines Objektes und wei ihn zu nutzen       Der Schreibtisch dient dir in deinem KintsugiLaden nun als Arbeitsbereich Hier entstehen all die Wunder die du vollbringen wirst und all die Schnheit die du erschaffen wirst      Das Regal wird das Podium dieser Schnheit whrend du darauf wartest dass der Kunde das Meisterwerk abholt       Bevor du deine Fertigkeiten der Welt zur Schau stellst geh noch mal in dich und mach einen Probedurchlauf Es ist nicht so als httest du es ntig schlielich hast du schon mindestens fnf KintsugiTutorials auf KeramaTube gesehen Es dient lediglich zum Aufwrmen       Die Schssel die dir vor 5 Minuten beim Instantnudeln machen aus der Hand gefallen ist bietet sich perfekt fr diese bung an      Whle mit dem Mauszeiger Keramikstcke aus und markiere sie mit deinem inneren Auge also mit Rechtsklick       Such nach weiteren Stcken die an den Rand des ersten Stckes passen knnten Dass die Stcke zusammengehren merkst du daran dass sich dein sechster Sinn einschaltet Ein nerviges Gerusch das dich schon durch so manche Puzzleturniere gebracht hat       Wenn du keine passenden Stcke findest solltest du die Stcke aus einer anderen Perspektive betrachten Aktiviere dein Adlerauge mit Linksklick um dir ein Keramikstck genau anzusehen und es zu drehen       Hast du mehrere Teile zusammengesetzt musst du sie nur noch miteinander verbinden Glcklicherweise hast du noch genug Kleingeld in der Tasche gefunden um den entsprechenden Klebstoff im ein Euro Laden zu kaufen       Eigentlich msstest du an den Klebestellen mit Goldstaub rbergehen Aus Kostengrnden machst du das erstmal mit einem goldenen Marker zumindest bis die erste Million in der Tasche ist       Sobald du fertig bist kannst du dir dein Meisterwerk noch mal von allen Seiten anschauen und anschlieend auf das prchtige Regal stellen      Danach kannst du direkt mit dem nchsten Auftrag weiter machen Schau dafr in dein Notizbuch       Es kann passieren dass du im Arbeitsprozess durch ein Klopfen unterbrochen wirst Das wird hchstwahrscheinlich ein Kunde sein der seine Bestellung abholen mchte Auch wenn er deine Konzentration unterbrochen hat versuch freundlich zu sein denk dran du hast einen KintsugiLaden und er nicht      Okay jetzt reicht es aber mit den Selbstgesprchen Rann an den Porzellan       Kurzer Text vor Level 1     Die InstantnudelnSchssel Tutorial       Ich glaube ich sollte noch mal in mich gehen und den Ablauf durchgehen       Zum Glck zerbrechen bei mir stndig Schsseln       Kurzer Text vor Level 2     Die Tasse Leicht       Mein erster richtiger Auftrag Ich wrde ja sagen dass ich aufgeregt bin wenn die Kundin nicht meine Mutter wre und ich sie nicht gezwungen htte den Auftrag einzureichen      Kurzer Text nach Level 2     Mutter Hallo mein Kind du hast mir 30 Nachrichten geschickt dass die Tasse fertig ist Wow das sieht wirklich interessant aus       Ich bereue zwar ein wenig dass ich sie nicht weggeworfen und mir einfach eine neue gekauft habe so wie ich es eigentlich geplant hatte Aber nun habe ich ein tolles Dekostck fr die freie Stelle hinten im Regal      Kurzer Text vor Level 3     Die Vase Mittel       Ein Kunde hat mir diese Vase zum Reparieren gegeben Er hat irgendwas ber seinen Vater erzhlt ich war aber so aufgebracht ber seine Strung whrend meiner Mittagspause dass ich ihm nicht richtig zugehrt habe Den komischen Sand den er mitgegeben hat kann ich aber super als Streckmittel fr den Kleber benutzen       Kurzer Text nach Level 3     Trauender Mann Die Urne sieht nun tatschlich viel besser aus als vorher Mein Vater wrde sich bestimmt freuen in einer so schicken und edlen Urne seinen Frieden zu finden Ich sehe Sie haben den Deckel versiegelt Das war eine gute Idee von Ihnen so geht nichts mehr verloren      Kurzer Text vor Level 4     Die Statue Schwer       Diese groe schwere Statue wurde mir von einem Mnch zumindest sah er so aus wie einer vorbeigebracht Das ist die bis jetzt grte Herausforderung Er faselte was von Ebenbild und Reinheit Ich war da aber bereits in Gedanken daran wie ich das Objekt in was wahrlich wunderschnes verwandele und konnte nicht richtig zuhren       Kurzer Text nach Level 4     Komischer Mnch Wie knnen Sie es W bla bla bla Das ist Blasphem  bla bla Ich sagte das Ebenbild darf nicht verun bla    Du erwischt dich selbst wie du dein Werk bewunderst und den Mnch ignorierst Ich sollte aufhren so oft in Gedanken zu schweben und den Menschen zuhren Egal er scheint nachvollziehbarerweise so begeistert davon zu sein dass er ganz aufgeregt ist Ich lasse die Zwei mal alleine Zum glck lasse ich mich im Voraus bezahlen  ",
