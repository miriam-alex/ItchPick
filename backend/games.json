At eight-years-old, nothing is better than what feels like endless days of school-less adventures, especially when you live walking distance from the beach. While coming home under a scorching sunset one fine evening, Jamie is approached by a stranger. The man is looking for a kid who can do him a favor, and he’s even offering to pay for it. He wants Jamie to please be friends with his only child. The person is Mr. Holden, Jamie’s new neighbor, as well as the father of the odd, and oddly named boy, Cove. Whether Jamie wants to play along or not, Cove isn’t going anywhere. He's present in Jamie's life for far longer than they ever would've guessed.\nAnd then the long days of vacation finally come to an end. Summer may not be able to last forever, but Jamie can take comfort in knowing it will come back again someday…\n&lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"https://gbpatch.itch.io/our-life-soundtrack\">Our&quot; class=&quot;redactor-linkify-object&quot;&gt;https://gbpatch.itch.io/our-life-soundtrack&quot;&gt;Our</a> Life: Beginnings &amp; Always - Soundtrack by GBPatch&lt;/a&gt;\n"

    "Game Title": "Our Life: Now & Forever",
    "Game Description": "Begin your life anew in this second installment to the lovingly nostalgic Our Life series! Create an experience that’s all your own in this near-fully customizable, choice-heavy story. A demo is available 🍂\n\nFall settles over the charming mountain town of Golden Grove as the story begins. But it isn't only glittering leaves that are changing. You and your mom leave behind everything you knew before when you move to a new home nestled right in the middle of a tight knit cul-de-sac. It’s there where a paper airplane lands at your feet and brings you to unanticipated crossroads.\nMake your own path through life as you grow from childhood to adulthood with your two closest neighbors. Even in the chilly autumn weather, it’ll be a truly heartwarming time.\nDeveloper: GB Patch Games\n\nPrice: Free-to-play base game with optional paid DLCs\n\nRelease Frame: When it's fully grown\nRating: Teen\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android\nPresskit: HERE\n\n           \n\n\n\nCreate the protagonist of your story:\nPick a first name, last name, honorifics, and have a nickname, too. Use any pronouns you prefer, including using multiple types and implementing your own set. Design your appearance using a dress-up doll, from skin tone, to hair, to clothes and accessories. Your mom’s appearance is partially customizable to have a family resemblance! \nTake it Step by Step:\nExperience four distinct periods of time: childhood, teen-aged, young adulthood, and grown. With all the highs and lows, the fears and fun, and the endless possibilities of self-discovery.\nLive as you please:\nExpress your personality and preferences through hundreds of choices, then see those traits reflected in the story as people remember who you are. And you can always change as the years go by, whether that means discovering a new passion, shifting your disposition, or transitioning to different pronouns.\nFind friendship, family, and romance:\nYour own mom, peers, their parents, teachers, and other acquaintances; there’s a whole community in Golden Grove, and it’s up to you to choose your place in it. Meaningful connections of all kinds can be nurtured. Is the stoic elderly man on the street scary or is he your new adopted grandpa?\nDevelop relationships that are truly yours:\nUse your own judgement to set how quickly bonds develop. Grow closer or farther apart as years go by. Focus on only one of the leads or be fond of both, including the option for a polyamorous relationship. And how you feel towards the people in your life is what determines your closeness. There are no limits on which behaviors you can have to be liked.\nEnjoy a world to return to:\nOur Life: Now & Forever features a welcoming, sentimental story that can easily be played over and over using new qualities for yourself or different relationship types with those around you.\nRead your way:\nCustomizable lettering size and font type, two different textbox arrangements to choose from, and a self-voicing option built into the engine. Present the words in whichever style works best for you.\n\n\n\nWhile you’ll be able to decide how fond you are of everyone in your life, there are two people you’ll meet whose connection to you will go deeper than all the rest: Qiu and Tamarack. Each one the same age as you and both living right next door. \nQiu “Autumn” Lin:\nA true Golden Grove local, born and raised. Qiu is the kid to know in that town. The most popular, the most charming, until it all becomes too much. There’s a point where a coldness comes over Qiu and they shut out all except a few people. However, the rain doesn’t fall forever, and sadness can heal with real support. The day comes when Qiu is able to shine again, even brighter than before. \nIn Autumn you will find a thoughtful individual who just needs some time to embrace the person they’ve always known they were. Qiu was assigned male at birth, but comes out as genderfluid (they/he) partway through the story.\n\n\n\nTamarack Baumann: \nA fellow newcomer, Tamarack moved in only about a week before you did. She’s a darling joy to those who get to have her company. And like the forests she loves so much, Tamarack is always changing in big and small ways. That isn’t always for the better. She’s surrounded by wrong branches, leading her down paths that only cause hurt. Yet despite all the pricks and snags on her path, the heart always remains the same.\nWith Tamarack you’ll see a kind miss who has a lot to learn about herself, but will never stop trying to find her way. Tamarack is a woman who only ever uses she/her pronouns.\n\n[Qiu and Tamarack have more than one hairstyle they can end up with in the future.]\n\nBuild your life with them:\nSet your unique \"dynamic meters\" that broadly describe how you behave towards one of the leads, keeping them consistent or switching that around as you grow up. Qiu's and Tamarack's dynamic towards you will develop in a custom way over the years based on who you are and what happens.\n\n\n\nA romance with Qiu or Tamarack can develop as love at first sight, a longtime platonic closeness turning into last-minute confessions, a slow and gradual growth of affection that started at nothing, or anything in between.\nFriendships form in just as many varied ways, ranging from immediate connections to hard-earned fondness, from casual company to irreplaceable family, and more. What you have together is complex with history and detail, yet still as natural as the leaves changing colors in the fall.\n\n\n\n\nJoin our Patreon to beta test scenes before their public launch and for sneak peeks!\n\n"

It’s entirely text-based, with choices throughout to shape both your main character’s personality and skills as well as influence their relationships with others. There are four love interests for you to choose from, both female as well as male, each with their own stories and secrets for you to uncover!\n I will release each chapter as I finish it, so the game will be a continuous work in progress. It will not be available for download until the entire game is finished.\nSOCIALS: Tumblr | Discord (16+ only) | Patreon | Ko-Fi | Email \nOF INTEREST: FAQ | Designing Your MC | Pinterest | Report a bug\nCONTENT WARNINGS: Depictions of violence, injuries and blood, death, trauma, psychological and physical body horror, sexually suggestive content and descriptions of animal cruelty. Safe to play for those 16 years and older.\n\nThe story takes place in Arsur, a fictional empire within a fantasy universe that draws inspiration from historical settings in the Middle East. Much of it is based on Kurdish culture, drawing from my own experience as a Kurdish woman. \nYour character is 25 years old and was born and raised in Arsur, where magic is considered a skill no different from reading or writing. Gender, sexual orientation, and race have no bearing on social position or class; it is instead only based on wealth and level of education. \nThe Arsurian Empire itself is overseen by a single ruler known as the Crown. Unlike traditional monarchies, however, the title is not inherited through blood. Whenever the Crown dies, their famed golden eyes pass on to the one chosen by the spirits of this world to be the new Crown: this appears to happen at random, as Crowns in the past have ranged from the poorest farmer to the wealthiest noble. \n\nTheir parents murdered and the previous Crown of Arsur assassinated, your character finds themselves on the run as they’ve been bestowed with the golden eyes that mark them as the new Crown. \nUnseen enemies at their heels, will they succeed as the Crown, or will they lead to the downfall of the Empire? \n\nAt the beginning of the story, you’ll have the opportunity to customize your  Crown’s name, pronouns, sexual orientation, and their skill in magic. You can also customize many parts of your Crown’s appearance: hair color, hair texture, hairstyle, skin color, height, and clothing style are all up to you and will be reflected in the story as well. \nTheir ethnicity and culture is locked in as Kurdish/Middle Eastern. The Crown is also locked in as a person of color, as is in line with the setting - their specific race is up to the player to imagine.\nAs for your Crown’s personality, there are twelve different character traits in total, six of which will be decided based on the choices you make in-game. This will subsequently change your Crown’s behavior during story and romance scenes. \n\nDepending on what your Crown’s sexual orientation is, the gender of the love interests will change accordingly to match that. There are four of them in total, and each love interest will have their own route which you will get to choose from at the end of the common route.\n\nThe Sorcerer; Rêzan/RozerînThe Crown’s Sorcerer, widely regarded to be a prodigy and expected to become the most powerful magus in the Empire. \n\nThe Hero; Xelara/XelefA legendary mercenary and the leader of the Crescent Blades, whose exploits were chronicled in song. Also known as the Pale Sword.\n\nThe Protector; Ashti/AzadOnce a peerless soldier in the Imperial Army, now promoted to the Royal Protector of the Crown due to their unrivaled skill and exceptional integrity.\n\nThe General; Dara/DelalThe General of the Imperial Army, known for many strategic victories in warding off attacks from hostile nations.\nArtwork of the characters done by @artbygaia!"

    "Game Title": "Scout: An Apocalypse Story",
    "Game Description": "Chapter 4 of Scout: An Apocalypse Story has been released! You have found the  People Across the Orange Plains. What will you do now?\nThis story is at about 60,000+  words thus far. I am planning for it to be 10 chapters, 100,000+ words upon completion (probably closer to 150,000 at this point). \nNext chapter? I'm estimating about one month. If you follow me on Tumblr, you'll know that my personal life has absolutely exploded recently. I'm a one woman team, so I've been on the back foot the past few months. Thank you all for your patience!\nIssues with saves?  Twine has a cache-based save system that I’m still trying to work around. If you’ve cleared your cache, cleared your cookies, have certain browser extensions, are using a different browser, are using a different device, etc. – you will not be able to access your old saves\nBut my saves are acting weird even if I haven’t cleared my cache: message me! Preferably on Tumblr or email. Letting me know what browser and version would be great to help troubleshoot. \nFollow me on Tumblr | Support me on Ko-fi\n---\nSummary\nIt has been over a decade since a worldwide natural disaster obliterated the natural planet and decimated human civilization. There are small groups of humans still alive, fending for themselves, trying to create communities amongst the rubble. \nYou are a 24-year old scout living in a small community on the edge of the Orange Plains. You lost your mother and your sister before finding your way here. You are primarily an academic, and you put your skills to use on regular scouting missions. With your best friend and your scouting team leader in tow, your small group is a pillar of the Community. \nOn your first scouting mission of the hot season, you meet the leader of the People Across the Orange Plains. Will you break from the Community you have known your whole life? Ask a romantic partner to join you? Discover secrets that your own people have been hiding? Become a leader yourself? \nGameplay\nChoose your name, pronouns, appearance, and scouting team position. Choices you make throughout the story will affect your standing in the community, your relationships, and significant plot points. This is primarily a romance game. \nRomance Options\nThere are 4 romance options in this game: Two male, one female, and one you can choose between M/F. \nElle/Ezra Taylor: Your best friend and another member of your scouting team. Charming and intuitive to your every feeling. You two have been inseparable ever since you both arrived to the Community around the same time. Recently, you are worried about losing your best friend to this new tension that seems to be developing between you both. \nOliver Shen: The leader of your scouting team. Impossible to impress. Easy to annoy. He has absurdly high standards for your scouting team and is constantly on your back. You enjoy openly challenging him on a regular basis. Oliver is intimidating, and you’ve never quite gotten along, but there are signs that he values you more than you initially realize. \nSabine Langford: A new addition to your scouting team. She is your replacement when you are put on probation. Sabine is a rule follower and abhors any risk-taking behavior from your team. You resent the addition of a fourth team member, especially one that seems to constantly be reprimanding you or getting in your way. But, when you’re in trouble, she always seems to be there. She has been paying attention to you. \nGage ??: Leader of another civilization group across the plains. You’ve run into each other briefly before on other scouting missions, and it has never ended well. He has shown a keen interest in you, and not only for your scouting skills. Gage intrigues you – he is from across the plains and could show you a completely different way of living through this apocalypse. If you’ll let him. \nContent Warnings\nViolence, language, sexual content. "

Any saves prior to 7/26/22 will not work properly!**\nLast Update: 5/7/24\nSpeaker is a modern fantasy character-driven interactive novel focusing on the relationships (romantic, familial, or otherwise) formed within your rag-tag group of misfits. It will be the first book in a series.\nBuild a relationship with your twin sister as well as 5 romanceable characters (one male, one female, one nonbinary, and 2 whose gender you choose). Choose one of seven routes - one for each RO, a polyam romance with Li and Sebastian, or eschew romance entirely!Have a shadow dog. He's a good boy.Go on road trips with your new friends and try to save people from a prophesied fate.\nLearn more about your family’s curse and what it means to be a Speaker.\nI make weekly progress updates on my tumblr blog.\nIf you'd like to support Speaker's development, I have a ko-fi and a patreon!\nWarnings: descriptions of blood, gore, and violence. Mentions of death. Nightmares. Being watched. A fair amount of swearing. I will update this list if anything applicable arises.\n ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nThe Story\nYour family is cursed.\nThe firstborn child in each generation is born a Seer, haunted by visions of the future they can neither stop nor control. For thirteen generations, they’ve suffered in silence, seeing death and disaster before it comes but unable to prevent it or even give it voice.\n\nYou are the second born.\n\nBorn only a few minutes after your twin sister, you avoided your family’s curse - by either luck or providence. As the twin sibling to your generation’s Seer, however, you have a rare and amazing gift. You are a Speaker, able to understand her visions and translate them in a way other people can understand. \n\nThe two of you have made a living hunting down and trying to stop them at the source, plucking people from the clutches of death. You aren’t always successful, and the pay is pretty much nonexistent, but it gives you a sense of purpose and hey, it’s still better than working retail.\n\nThe visions are becoming more frequent lately, and their contents more violent. Is there a thread connecting them that you aren’t able to see? Or is this just a sign of the times?\n\nEither way, one thing is for sure: it’s too much for just the two of you. You’re going to need help.\n ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nCharacters\nThe Speaker\nThis is you, the player character. The twin sibling of a Seer, you narrowly avoided being the Chosen One pretty much just by the flip of a coin. Part caretaker, part private investigator, part vigilante, you travel the country trying to prevent your sister’s terrible visions from coming true. Your name, appearance, gender, pronouns, and personality are all customizable.\nThe Seer\nYour twin sister. Older than you by four minutes, she suffers from the curse you avoided, plagued by visions of pain and death that she can only speak of to you. Stubbornly optimistic in spite of her powers, she is rarely seen without a smile. On bad days, she has trouble telling what’s real and what’s a vision, but that doesn’t stop her from trying to live her best life. Her appearance is determined by the Speaker’s, and her name is chosen by you.\nThe Dog\nA Black Dog that has imprinted himself on you and your sister. He is about the size of an Irish Wolfhound, though he can increase or shrink his size depending on canine whim. Likes to go on car rides. Begs for food scraps even though he can’t eat them. Goodest boy. Name is decided by the player.\n\nThe Dryad-Next-Door - Azalea Mirin\nAzalea has lived next door to you for as long as you can remember, and your families are long-time friends. Gentle, soft-spoken, and unassuming, she can often be found working in her garden, and she regularly brings you pies or muffins she’s made using the things she grows. Az is very much a homebody, and has very adamantly refused to travel with you in all the years you’ve known her, though she doesn’t mind housesitting if you ask nicely.\nAzalea is a romanceable character.\nThe Austere Detective - Sebastian Wynric\nA private detective that you hired to help with your sister's latest vision. He doesn’t talk much and can sometimes be a little sharp-tongued, but he seems ultimately harmless - or, at the very least, he means you and your sister no harm. You’re pretty sure he isn’t fully human, but he’s never said anything about it and you’re not sure if it would be rude to ask.\nSebastian is a romanceable character.\nThe Quiet Witch - Liam/Lily/Li Cowles\nA healer, and potentially an old friend. Your family and theirs have been familiar with each other for generations, but you haven’t seen them since you were children. You remember them being quiet and shy, but surprisingly mischievous, and it seems that has carried into adulthood. They lean really heavily into the “spooky” angle of witchcraft, but you’re not sure how much of that is just for appearances.\nLi's gender is chosen by the player. They are a romanceable character.\nThe Mysterious Musician - Kana\nKana is a traveling musician who you keep bumping into. They found themself in the wrong place at the right time and have been dragged into your adventures, though they seem willing enough to go along with it... for now. They keep their cards close to their chest, and you aren't sure how much of what they tell you about themself is true - you aren't even sure Kana is their real name - but they seem to genuinely want to help.\nKana is a romanceable character.\nThe Merry Wanderer - Roderick/Aurora “Rory” Kane\nThe victim in your sister’s latest vision. You manage to save their life, but at what cost? Friendly, outgoing, and perhaps a little too trusting, their resemblance to a golden retriever is almost uncanny. Never one to stay in one place for long, Rory has decided to travel with you for now... both for your safety, and their own.\nRory's gender is chosen by the player. They are a romanceable character.\n ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nCredits\nThank you to my mom for being my first and biggest fan.

Reliable and loyal, A is always by your side and there when you need a good laugh. With an easygoing manner and sarcastic sense of humour, A is loved by all, though their greatest friend is you.\nWill you blur the lines of friendship?\nTHE RIVAL.\nBlane Rekner is a fellow hunter at IAOS and your rival. Blane despises you with a passion and will take every opportunity to make you look bad, often in the form of a snide remark. Cold and startlingly rude, Blane isn’t the most appealing person, but their loyalty and dedication make up for it.\nWill you turn your tension into something more than hatred?\nTHE PARTNER.\n\nNikolas/Noele/Nolan Alves is Blane’s partner at IAOS. though often overlooked, with soft smiles and constant genuine kindness, N is someone you can count on when having a bad day. But don’t let that fool you, for N also has a strong will and disregard for being treated badly that will make you rethink double-crossing them.\n\nWill you find something real in a sea of mistrust?\nTHE WARLOCK.\nKian/Kaia/Kai de Vries is a warlock you see out for their expertise. as an immortal, K has learned to keep their cards close to their chest and finds it difficult to trust. Their aloofness and blunt sense of humour may make them difficult to get along with at first, but once warmed up to you, K is a powerful ally that proves to have a great amount of depth.\nWill you fall for someone you know you will have to one day leave behind?\nTHE BOUNTY.\nRylan Villanueva is a bounty you’ve previously failed to capture. A flirt through and through, Rylan’s signature moves are sharp smirks and quick winks, the signs of someone who enjoys the sight of someone flustered. Their sarcasm and charm often take up the forefront of their personality, but though seemingly shallow with their wandering eyes, Rylan’s bed remains empty, preferring to spend nights alone.\nWill you find love with the very person you’ve been trained to hunt?\n\n\nI make regular updates and answer questions about the cast and game on my Tumblr.

Combined, they were worth over a billion dollars.\nNow, due to the eccentricities of their great, great grandfather, Elias their money must be redistributed to the rest of the family. But who's actually a BLOOD RELATIVE? That's where you come in.\nArmed only with the power of your mighty dial-up modem, you'll scour for photos, books, articles, and other evidence. Then, you'll make connections and deductions based on the family relationships you uncover. With every spot on the tree you fill in correctly the names and photos left in your possession will have fewer and fewer places to go, but the evidence will also be harder and more obscure to find.\nCan you find the final pieces of the puzzle?\nThis is the original version of The Roottrees are Dead, initially conceived for the Global Game Jam 2023. It was released for free on itch.io due to its reliance on AI art. The remake on Steam includes illustrations and voice acting, improved puzzles, an expanded story with dozens more characters, important bug fixes, as well as countless interface and quality of life improvements.

    "Game Description": "Promises to Keep (PTK) is a queer, furry, safe-for-work (16+) visual novel. Please be warned that while entirely safe-for-work, PTK does feature themes of religious & familial trauma, injury, mental illness, minor body horror, and homophobia. Some scenes may not be suitable for individuals with epilepsy (but there are in-game warnings for these scenes). v0.6 is now available (up to Day 3 of every route). This version has around 10 hours of content, featuring an original soundtrack of 20+ songs, 50+ beautifully drawn backgrounds and fully-illustrated CGs, and 100+ unique character sprites.  Find us on Twitter and support us on Patreon for early game updates, exclusive content, art raffles, and if you’d like to be featured in PTK as a cameo!\nA promise is the greatest, most significant thing anyone can make, in a reality where nothing is permanent. They are guarantees we make to one another, knowing that guarantees are fruitless; their existence contradicts the fleeting, temporary nature of our universe. Yet, they live on in the face of this futility.\n\nSo, what happens when the promises you make to yourself go cold? When your promises to others are left empty?\n\nPTK follows the journey of a post-college snow leopard after returning to his childhood home. After a year of wishful thinking, living in the footsteps of his past and the childhood promises he has yet to fulfill, he's convinced there's nothing more for him here. Then, disaster strikes.\n\nJoin him in a story of deep self-discovery, reunion, and light-hearted romance as he grows with a vibrant group of individuals brought together by unlikely circumstances.\n\n** Please note that all content is subject to change as the game undergoes further development, and that the current version may not fully represent the final game. **\nLooking for translations of PTK? Here's a list of unofficial fan-translations that we've been extremely fortunate to receive from the community -- please note that as developers, we don't necessarily speak the languages used in these translations, and as such, can't thoroughly vet the games to ensure they reflect the original version accurately.

    "Game Title": "Perfumare [VN]",
    "Game Description": "A dark fantasy visual novel with elements of mystery and romance set in a fictional world not so different from ours, where some people are born with a strange affliction called 'the gift'.\nDISCLAIMER\n\nDo not reupload  or redistribute Perfumare or any of the assets. Streaming the game is only allowed if commentary is added to it.\n\nPerfumare (Visual Novel) is a teaser of the Interactive Fiction (text-based game) Perfumare: Avulsion [WIP] and as so, it only showcases the key scenes of the secondary plot (3 branches) leading to one of the two \"common\" endings or several 'miscellaneous' endings.\nPerfumare (Visual Novel) can be played as a standalone and doesn't require any knowledge of Perfumare: Avulsion. Do bear in mind that the content is shorter, scenes are skipped and the pace is rushed to keep all three routes equal in length. \nRomance and friendship routes (romance-leaning in this demo, but you can finish the game as only-friends with the RO if you want to check their route but don’t want to romance them).\n\nSuggested order: Reed - Jewel - Laurent \n\nMain differences between the demo and the IF: \n\n- the demo is a Visual Novel, the full game is text-based (public version),\n- only one ending seen in the demo carries out to the IF (it ends the arc I), others should be treated as non-canon,\n- the IF doesn't contain any dead endings, even if a certain scene would have resulted in MC's death in the demo, it doesn't in the IF,\n- the IF presents more ways to deal with a problem., In the demo I went with one/two options I found more interesting to write,\n- there are things MC knows in the demo that they don't know in the IF, i.e. the type of relationship (which is strictly business partners) Reed has with his 'friends' etc.\n\nSetting: dystopian urban/dark fantasy\nTags: crime, mystery, romance (it is not a horror game)\n\nAmnesia isn’t a tag because a)it’s temporary b)it’s used to introduce players to the setting.\n\nWarning: Violence, explicit language, drug portrayal (including alcohol and tobacco), themes of death and suicide.\n\n\nRating: 17+ (public version)\n\n\n- A nameable protagonist defined through in-game choices,\n- She/her, they/them and he/him pronouns to choose from,\n- 3 Romance Options: 2 male and 1 female,\n- 3 Routes, each with a unique storyline,\n- Choices that matter (lead to a different outcome/scene) and choices that let you customize your MC (the way they look, react to certain things and their opinions).\n- Words in total AS OF CHAPTER VI: 170 000\n- Words per route AS OF CHAPTER VI: 83 000\n\nCharacter profiles:\nJewel: your coworker of three years. Best described as 'pessimistic' and 'prepared for everything'. Though she seems distant and aloof she is sweet and caring to those who earned her love and trust, but merciless and unforgiving to those who abused it.\nReed: your ex-classmate and childhood friend all in one. Best described as 'that one smirky bastard' and 'a ride-or-die'. He's not very effusive, and sometimes it's hard to tell if he means the things he says or if he's plotting something nefarious at other's expense. \nLaurent: an SPD agent and an unlikely friend you've met by chance a year or so ago. Best described as 'austere workaholic' and 'perfectionist to a fault'. He's like mentos;  hard on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\n\nThis story is a work of fiction, set in a DYSTOPIAN country. Some of the events, backstories, or choices might be (and should be) morally reprehensible for an ordinary person.\n\nFurthermore, Perfumare is rated MATURE for: scenes of explicit violence, strong language, mind-altering substances (including alcohol and tobacco), themes of crime, death and suicide, mentions of injuries, nightmares, temporary amnesia.*\n\nProceed at your own risk.\n*full & updated list shows up at the start of the game\n\nVisual Novel Engine: Ren'Py by Tom Rothamel\nWriting, GUI, coding, art: PDRRook\nCoding help: Dom \nProofreaders/editors: Dom, Cassiel, Steph 'Jeneara' M., thefoxthefox, Pugsie, Pauline (Chapters I-V), pheranthes (Chapters I-II), victoriel, Dom \nLanguage consultant (Italian): Sciambalala\nBeta players: aforementioned + acsm, berbicacho, redmoonfoxes, Zoe A.M.\nFonts, Free for Personal and Commercial Use: \nChannel Tuning by Brain EatersAmethysta by Konstantin Vinogradov\nTextures: CC0textures\nLicensed under the Attribution License:\nUnlocking Security Door by digifishmusic\nLicensed under the CC0 License: (check the 'about' section in-game)\n\nHuge thanks to my patrons, most notably:\nAaron ✰  Abby ✰  acchandesu ✰  Actias L. ✰  Aileani ✰  aiseaisebb ✰  Alix L. ✰  alphatwelve ✰ Alysse M. ✰  Amadeus M. ✰  Amy R. ✰  Anna ✰  Anna Maria ✰  Anna R ✰  Aonith ✰  Becca ✰ beyondthecrown ✰  Blanche ✰  Boo ✰  Bri ✰  bspearss ✰  c0uch ✰  Cait ✰  Cassiel ✰  Ceinwin ✰ Chaeldra ✰  CharityBlacks ✰  Cheyenne B. ✰  Christina Palmer ✰  Clamoribusrogamina ✰ Clay ✰  Cods ✰  Conspícua ✰  cremaydurazno ✰  Dana ✰  Danielle W. ✰  del ✰  Dien ✰  duki ✰ eldritchPup ✰  Emily M. ✰  Emily M. ✰  Estel D. ✰  Eunice M. ✰  Fair fax ✰  Frenchqt ✰  freya ✰ Gaby T. ✰  Georgia M ✰  Godwhy ✰  Graciela F. ✰  haledamage ✰  Helen ✰  Icky Pop ✰ Ilonka L. ✰  IN KA ✰  Ingledsy ✰  James II ✰  Jay ✰  jayde b. ✰  Jennifer L. ✰  Jenny S ✰  Jess ✰ Joker Too Godly ✰  Juhasz B. ✰  Julija A. ✰  Junesong ✰  K ✰  Kachance ✰  Kaiisy ✰ kaileebee~ ✰  Kassandra V. ✰  Kat M. ✰  Kat V. ✰  Kate A. ✰  Katherine ✰  Katrina G. ✰ KCups ✰  Kim ✰  kingdom-dance ✰  Kit ✰  Krissy ✰  Kujo ✰  Leigh B. ✰  Lenia ✰  leondaltons ✰ Liberty ✰  LifeOnFilm ✰  lilith ✰  Lindsey J. ✰  Linh ✰  Lisa ✰  LizzyTinker ✰  logan_n ✰  Lolza ✰ Loveliest ✰  Lucerni ✰  lucian G. ✰  Luna ✰  M ✰  Mad_as_a_Hatter ✰  Mal ✰  Marianne ✰ Marissa M. ✰  Marz ✰  maya ✰  Mayowa A. ✰  Meira L. ✰  Mel ✰  Meyaa 258 ✰ MillenialStargazer ✰  Milli Vanilli ✰  mintie ✰  Miralein ✰  Mivek ✰  Morgan L. morrigan p. ✰ moss ✰  mothermayhem ✰  mrissti ✰  Natasha ✰  neridavale ✰  Noah ✰  NoFace ✰  OGPurin ✰ ONISM ✰  Patricia~ ✰  patrn ✰  Peachick ✰  pugs ✰  Qtie ✰  Queen of Antiva ✰  R ✰ Rabble Rebble ✰  Rachel W. ✰  rajakustannus ✰  Random name ✰  Reid ✰  Renn ✰  reverie ✰ RougeDavo ✰  Rubellite ✰  Rue ✰  Ryan ✰  Sabrina R. ✰  Saffron ✰  salara.roll ✰  Sara K. ✰ Shanna G. ✰  Sheena F ✰  Shuris ✰  Shuu ✰  si si ✰  Sophie ✰  Starlight ✰  Stellan M. ✰  steph ✰ Steph 'Jeneara' M. ✰  Svetlana M. ✰  Sxramona ✰  Sybylladella ✰  TeaAndStrumpets ✰ Teagan H. ✰  TheMuseBattle ✰  Tristen C. ✰  Turtleqwre ✰  Twirly Muffin ✰  Urtica ✰  Valeria ✰ Vesper E. ✰  Victoriel ✰  Vile Youth ✰  W.

As such, I was tempted to test and implement neutral and dead endings into the narrative. I soon discovered that I don't like this approach, but it is, nonetheless, something that plays a great part in the demo for consistency's sake. \nSome of the mini guides for the early chapters can be found on my Ko-Fi (free to read, the rest is explained [here]. As a hint, I can say that the early choices matter, the ones that don't give you an immediate result. \nThe translations:\nSince it's really up to the player if MC can speak/understand other languages or not, I didn't want to add subtitles on-screen. That said, the translation can be found in the codex section of the game (that little notebook icon in the upper left corner of the screen). It unlocks after a notification \"Codex: Glossary\" pops up on the screen.\nFor streaming and recording:\nSince the game is free, I'd only ask you to limit the recording to the prologue, as to keep it relatively spoiler-free.\nMy antivirus doesn’t let me open the game/ I get a virus warning, why?\n\nIt's a false positive, which is a common issue if you play indie-made games. You can read more about it [here] and [here] and [here] and [here] or you can contact your antivirus providers and/or support so they can check the files for you.\nPlease check the full [FAQ] before asking a question.

    "Game Title": "Viatica",
    "Game Description": "\nVIATICA is fully released!\nAn Interactive Fiction set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future, with a focus on personal growth, as well as platonic, familial, and romantic bonds.\nYour world is a desert, both figuratively and literally. Speech is prohibited, books are outlawed, and any meaningful human interaction is nonexistent. Humans are reduced to the job they do for The City. There are no names; instead, everyone is identified by a number.\nYou are H-313, a healer.\nCreate and customize your character: male, female, or non-binary; gay, straight, or bisexual. Become an individual in a world of drones. Learn to speak, express your emotions, define your personality. Dream big, resist tyranny, inspire the masses, and forge a new world. Or not. This is your journey, after all.\nThere are no point-based choices or outcomes. No choice is wrong—it simply changes the type of person you grow to become.\nCultivate relationships with others, both romantic and platonic. More flirty/confidant romance options are marked with a ❤️, while more oblivious/subconscious options are marked with a 💛. It’s difficult to understand emotions, after all, when you barely understand words. Once you're locked into a route, ❤️ denotes scenes with physical intimacy. You can still further the romance without that.\n\nRomance Options:\nB-485, Lion (he/him)\nHe is a builder, stoic and strong. He is tall and muscular with brown skin and black, coiled hair and beard. At 26 he is the eldest of the group. Later in the story, he chooses the name Lion for himself. He is fierce and protective of those he cares for. But what truly sets him apart from other workers is his ability to speak clearly and articulately. How? More to the point, can he teach you?\nF-525, Heron (he/him)\nHe is a feeder, aloof and placid. He is medium height, with long blonde hair usually tied back in a ponytail and pale blue eyes. He is 22 years old, same as you. Later in the story, he chooses the name Heron for himself. He does not question his role, nor act in any way contrary to what is expected. What passions and tempers will you find when that veneer cracks? More importantly, why does he seem so familiar?\nS-622, Ferret (she/her)\nShe is a sweeper, slender and scrappy. She is medium height, with olive skin, dark brown hair and narrow grey eyes. She is 21 years old. Later in the story, she chooses the name Ferret for herself. She is impulsive, stubborn, and quick to anger. When you first meet her she is very combative, but you eventually see the fearless and inquisitive soul underneath. Could she be a kindred spirit, or perhaps even more?\nR-793, Robin (they/them)\nThey are a burner, lithe and wary. They have ivory skin, curly red hair, and heterochromia: one eye is green, the other brown. They are 20 years old. Later in the story, they choose the name Robin for themself. In a world where roles are based on gender and strict definitions of what a worker is, they have always felt out of place. Their discomfort was made worse by a recent traumatic experience. Can you help them to accept and appreciate the worthy person that they are?\nContent Warning: This story is intended for mature audiences. Possibly triggering topics present in the story include blood, violence, death, suicide, rape (mentioned), child abuse, mature language, and sexual content (optional).\nAbout the Author: I am a mom of teens and have a challenging career, both of which demand my time so please bear with me!

    "Game Description": "ClanGen is a fan game originally created by just-some-cat on Tumblr\n\nWelcome to the ClanGen itch.io page! ClanGen is a game that lets you generate a Clan and then follow their story as it unfolds, perhaps influencing some of their decisions along the way. With, quite literally, millions of unique cat appearances to generate, multiple biomes and camps to live within, and hundreds of events to discover, ClanGen is full of possibilities! What will your Clan look like? \nDownloading is fairly straight forward, but below are the most frequently asked questions, including how to get the game. If you have any other questions that aren't answered, join us on our discord, where a much more in-depth FAQ is available.\n\nLinks:\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/clangen\nGithub: https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen\nOnline Version: https://clangen-web.github.io/ (note: this version is often behind the downloadable version as far as updates go, and may delete your cats between updates. If possible, the itch.io download is recommended) \n\nFAQs: \nI can't seem to access the .exe file, or the .exe file keeps disappearing: We've recently been having some issues with the antivirus on windows. While the base ClanGen game is safe, we do not guarantee the safety of any mods or third-party downloads. Proceed with caution if you plan on trying to get around any antivirus warnings, and at this time we do not recommend installing any mods that do not have the source code publicly available and even then to use caution. \n Does this game run on Mac/Linux/Windows 7:\nYes; thank you to Blackfur and Shou for developing those releases. And to others that have picked up the torch since.\nDoes this game run on Android/Mobile:\nNo it does not, and the only software libraries I found for converting pygame to mobile use python 2, while this game uses python 3. Until those are updated to python 3, there will not be any mobile releases of ClanGen.\n\nCan I help out with the development:\nSure, join the discord or pull up the Github. I love community driven and open source projects\n\nHelp, I am getting (insert error here):\nUnfortunately it can be hard to troubleshoot based on the errors, again, I would advise joining the discord where you can share screenshots and get a faster response time. \nHow do I download this:\nDownload the Release zip file from itch.io (you may have to scroll down) for the proper operating system. Find where that downloaded, and right click to extract all the files. Once it is extracted, you need to run the file called Clangen.exe. If the only file named main you see is main.py, you somehow got the source code instead of the release, try downloading it again. If it gives an error and won't open, make sure that you have extracted it before trying to open. \n\nDo I need the 64 or 32 bit version:\nMost Windows 10 and all Windows 11 computers use 64 bit. If that doesn't work for you, try the 32 bit. You can check to be certain following these instructions."

It elicits dark feelings, but asks players to consider where those feelings came from and what makes them dark.”— Kotaku\nOne Of Polygon's Best Games of 2017 — \"The video game industry is built on the destruction of bodies of all kinds.

It scared me. It moved me. Most of all, it made me stop what I was doing and think.” – EuroGamer\n\"8/10 — [A Mortician's Tale] is a short game, only an hour or so long, but it leaves an impact far beyond its runtime.

    "Game Title": "God-Cursed: Demo",
    "Game Description": "\nYou were found as a newborn, clutched in the arms of your dead mother at the base of a tree. No family came to claim you, but the men who came to your rescue adopted you as their own and became the only parents you’ve ever known. Growing up in the village of Stonebrook, you never want for much, until the day you first fall ill. Life plagues you with a mysterious condition that no one can diagnose or cure. You never know when it will strike or if it will eventually kill you. Living between fear and hope as you age, you try to come into your own as an adult with the ever-looming threat above you. As years pass, your condition seems to improve, until a mysterious mark appears on your body and opens up new questions.\n\nIt appears that you’re marked for death with no answers as to why, and your only chance to survive is to go out and seek them.\n\nJourney through the land of Iroda, a fantasy world where the gods have abandoned their people and magic no longer prevails as it once did. Something is brewing that may change this world forever, and you’re in the middle of it, though your role is a mystery you must solve. Wanted dead by some and alive for mysterious purposes by others, you just want to survive. With the help of a few friends, find the answers that you need, and make your choices.\n\nCustomize your character’s looks, gender, sexuality, and personality.

Once a free-spirited softie with a perpetual smile and a penchant for mischief, Oswin has grown into a dour adult. After he came of age, he slowly distanced himself from you. In the ten years since, interactions between you have been awkward or downright hostile with no in-between. He doesn’t joke anymore. He doesn’t smile anymore. There’s something lost about his eyes these days…\n\n-Personality: Despite that furrow in his brow that says ‘stay away,’ Oswin actually prefers being in the company of others, as he cares deeply for friends and family. He’s organized and thorough – valuing the predictable and structured, and being driven to always improve upon his skills. Oswin can also be self-conscious, hard on himself, and a bit insecure.\n\n-Appearance: Standing around 6'2\"/188cm with an athletic build, Oswin has black hair that is slightly wavy and kept to his ears, bright-green hooded eyes, and brown skin with bronze undertones. He has a firm squared jaw, which is often prickled with light scruff. Oswin most often scowls, even when he doesn’t necessarily intend to. He dresses in simple tunics with leather armor and boots and isn’t one for frivolities save for a special tattoo & necklace hidden under his clothing. A few notable scars mar his flesh, each telling a story. His sword is always kept at his hip.\n\n\nZahn\n(gender selectable)\nA sweet and fun soul whom you meet along your journey. Zahn is just trying to fulfill their duty to their faith. They seek to help you in any way they can, though there’s something torn behind their smile. Where did this fun-loving acolyte come from, and why do they look so sad when they think no one is looking?\n\n-Personality:  social and sweet, Zahn is enthusiastic and open-minded about most things. They’re incredibly flexible (in mind and body) and see possibilities in everything, being highly adaptable and skilled at improvising. Casual, warm, and always friendly and willing to lend a hand, they can make a very trustworthy companion.\n\n-Appearance: about 5'5\"/165cm tall with a petite build, wild blond hair, and round blue eyes, Zahn has fawn-colored skin with a rosy hue, and a dusting of light freckles with a touch too much wind and sun across their cheeks and nose. They appear a bit tired with slightly sunken eyes and a mite too thin with the lines of their jaw and neck a bit too pronounced – evidence of years of difficult living. If they grace you with a toothy smile, you may be lucky enough to see the slight gap in their front teeth. Zahn dresses in rough linen tunics, usually with layers to make up for how thin and hole-filled they are. They have a particularly ratty cloak that they seem to cherish.\n\n\nDuri’naan\n[AKA: Duri] (gender selectable)\nA demigod to whom you owe a debt, they seem quite curious about you.\n\n-Personality: charming and laid-back, Duri prefers their own company most of the time but readily embraces tight friendships, of which they never tire – though it is all or nothing for them, no surface-level relationship will work for long. They are perpetually curious and casual, having an air of cool confidence and a love for teasing, which can sometimes make them appear disinterested or cold. They are always paying attention, even if it doesn’t seem like it, and often understand others more than themselves. They can stress easily – especially when things stop being fun, being a bit competitive, and too independent for their own good.\n\n-Appearance: Standing approximately 5'9\"/175cm with a lithe but toned build, Duri’naan has long and straight grey hair and honey-brown upturned eyes. Their skin is a warm beige, lit up with a bright smile that sometimes shows off a little sharp snaggle-tooth. They bear a strange scar on the back of their neck and are missing a bit from the upper part of one ear. Duri wears simple clothing made from a single and very long swath of blue-grey linen, wrapped around them in such a way that you’re not quite sure how it stays up. They also hate shoes for some reason and are always barefoot.\n\n\nRūndis Lyreheart\n[AKA: Rune] (gender selectable)\nA serious and powerful mage with an oddly fervent dedication to the God of Destruction, Casimir. Though they are capable of wielding great power, they prefer to spend their days as a traveling bard – saying it’s for the purpose of angering their mother. They’d have you think they could not care less about your plight, yet cannot resist lending a hand.\n\n-Personality: Rūndis is an introverted daydreamer who is curious and in search of deeper meanings at all times. Though they dream, they also have a rational side that comes with a penchant for efficiency and decisiveness. They tend to be calm and analytical, but are prone to anxiety especially in close relationships, making them seem a bit aloof or combative.\n\n-Appearance: Standing around 5'7\"/173cm, Rune has shoulder-length curly hair that is all black except for a flash of purple on one side. They have almond-shaped purple eyes that are a testament to the magic that flows easily through them, and a beauty mark just under their right eye. They have a strong build and umber skin, wearing a stoic and serious expression that you wouldn’t expect from a bard. Rune favors fine robes and cloaks in colors that match their eyes, but only when they choose to stand out, otherwise they prefer common clothing. Tattooed upon their chest as a sign of devotion is the sigil of Casimir. They also adorn themselves with different types of jewelry.\n\nThanks so much for taking a look, I hope you enjoy!\n~ Lunan\nFor more information or to ask a question, check out my Tumblr:  https://www.tumblr.com/blog/wings-of-ink\nError Report Form is linked the game menu."

    "Game Title": "Our Wonderland",
    "Game Description": "\n  \n\n\nEleven-year-old Iggy wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he dragged his friends out to the woods to attempt a strange ritual from a book he found in the dumpster at school, but his wildest imagination couldn’t have prepared him for the land of wonder and magic that awaited them at the bottom of that old willow tree.\n  Now, however, it’s twenty years later, and he and his friends are past the age of make-believe. The wonderland of their youth has become nothing more than a far-off dream—until one night, Bucks and her newborn daughter disappear without a trace. Soon, Iggy and his friends find themselves pulled back into that world of childish glee. Only their wishes and desires aren’t so innocent anymore, and the world has twisted itself into a land of horror and depravity that’s scarcely recognizable.\n\n\nOur Wonderland is a horror-fantasy visual novel focusing on the struggles, issues, and deteriorating relationships between five childhood friends (amplified to horrific effect). I think of it a bit like an overwrought character drama that happens to include horrific and fantastical things. It contains five different arcs, each with its own ending, and your choices affect the amount of peril the protagonist experiences (hint: how many times Iggy violently dies), as well as the final ending (hint: who Iggy ends up with at the very end, because apparently in some messed-up way, this is also the world's worst dating sim).\nAs an extra note, this game also touches on a lot of LGBTQIA+ themes.\n\nThe intrepid cast or something. (Click to zoom!)\n\nThe full game is now complete! It features:\n    A dramatic story told in five arcs, each with its own endingFour possible epilogues20 to 25 hours of playtime (around 288k words)Storybook-style visuals\n    520 CGsSome super sweet animatic-style cutscenes\n    12 ways to violently die!\n    A fun cinematic soundtrack and lots of dramatic sound effects\n\n\nCONTENT WARNINGS\nOur Wonderland is recommended for mature audiences only. The game includes:\n  \n    Strong adult language\n    Strong graphic violence (both illustrated and textual)\n    Sexual violence/assault/unwanted sexual advances\n    Disturbing and potentially triggering elementsAnd, more specifically for each arc, these general content warnings apply:(Arc 3) Topics involving suicide, self-harm, and self-poisoning\n(Arc 4) Overarching sexual themes (extra strong)\n(Arc 4) Intense and disturbing scenes (extra strong)\n(Arc 4) Bullying and harassment, bigoted comments related to gender\n(Arc 4) Drugging\n(Arc 5) Intense action sequences with quick movements, shaking screen and sprites, flashing lights, eye strain, and simulated temporary hearing loss(Arc 5) Arachnophobia(Arc 5) Brief dialogue on eating disorder topics\n(Arc 5) Scenes revolving around childbirth and gender roles\n(Arc 5) Moments of extra strong language and sexual references\n(Arc 5) Disturbing violence against an infant\n  \n  These are the general content warnings.

someone's previous injury is exacerbated and their stiches ripped out, leading to some blood; someone's arm is completely bitten through by a rabbit; someone is implied to have cut their heart out and the remaining scar is shown, brief flashes of CGs are shown in silhouette of the act occurring; a censored room filled with flayed bodies and viscera is shown while the scene is described in detailed text and it's very intense; multiple people are held captive and repeatedly slammed to the ground, resulting in various injuries, broken jaws and noses, etc.; someone's finger is chopped off and both the finger and stump are shown multiple times in detail; someone bites off a piece of a rabbit's arm; someone uses a knife to cut open someone's chest and then yank it open further rather viscerally)Sexual references, sexual violence/assault/unwanted sexual advances (sexual humor, jokes, and references are made throughout, including usage of the word d*ck; references are made to a past instance of sexual harassment; mean-spirited taunts of a sexual nature about another character are made during an argument, someone has a lascivious-looking expression at times; someone presses their foot into someone else's face)Disturbing and potentially triggering elements (implied cannibalism, both of human and rabbit nature; implied past torture and captivity; multiple characters are held captive and threatened and taunted with a large knife; references are made to past instances of bullying)Intense action sequences, eye strain, and flashing movements (a fight scene against many small red beings occurs in which the creatures are constantly running quickly across the screen, whipping in and out of view, and sometimes zooming large in front of the screen, the screen flashes and shakes a number of times; a fight/chase scene in an attempt to storm a castle occurs in which multiple rabbits quickly flash across the screen many times, coupled with flashing and screen shake; a scene in a darkened room occurs in which occasional flashes of lightning brighten up the entire screen; a chase scene in a castle occurs in which many rabbits flash across the screen and the screen shakes a number of times; a scene occurs in which glitchy text and VHS-esque staticy effects are superimposed across the screen)Moments of extra strong adult language (an argument occurs in which there is an exorbitant number of occurrences of the word f*ck)\n\n\n  Finale Detailed Content Warnings\n    Strong graphic violence (action sequences include descriptive depictions of violence, including characters getting bitten, hit, kicked, slashed, knocked to the ground, etc; characters emerge from action sequences boasting a lot of cuts and bruises; one character has their hand half chopped off)Sexual references, sexual violence/assault/unwanted sexual advances (sexual humor, jokes, and references are made throughout; references are made to erections and genitalia; apologies are made re: past sexual assault attempts)Disturbing and potentially triggering elements (references made to prior instances of cannibalism and torture; a character helps care for another character's severed appendage and the descriptions are rather visceral)Intense action sequences, eye strain, and flashing movements (a fight scene against a large creature occurs in which the creature and its limbs often move quickly across the screen, and the characters fighting it also move quickly to and fro; a short fight scene involving many large root-like objects occurs in which many roots flash across the screen and attack the characters; a short sequence involving a BG and character sprites with inverted colors occurs; a short sequence involving chroma glitch effects and static-like noise on the BG occurs; a short moment in which the sound goes muffled and a tinnitus-style sound effect plays, simulating temporary hearing loss, occurs; a few scenes include floating particle-style effects that move across the screen)Disturbing violence against an infant (an infant is held in captivity, implied to have been killed/bludgeoned, and has now turned into a bloated mass; the CG showing this has been hard-censored, but there are still textual descriptions that are rather visceral)\n\n  There isn't any nudity/on-screen sex/NSFW content in the game. I generally think of it like an R-rated movie (17+). HOWEVER. In Arc 4  specifically, the intensity gets amped up, particularly during the finale. I do recommend 18+ for that arc individually simply due to the intensity and overarching sexual themes. I'm also happy to provide more details if any of the aspects above have you concerned and you'd like to go in prepared! Many of the scenes in the game are supposed to be uncomfortable—but not to the point that I would want anyone to be pushed past their limits. So please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns and I'm happy to provide more details, screenshots, etc.This game also includes a Censored Mode! This mode spot-pixelates elements of gore (intestines, etc.) within the CGs, which may be helpful if you're interested in the game but squeamish about gore.\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://carrotpatchgames.itch.io/our-cinderella\">Our Cinderella by Carrot</a>\n<a href=\"https://carrotpatchgames.itch.io/our-fantastic-wonderland\">Our Fantastic Wonderland by Carrot</a>\n<a href=\"https://carrotpatchgames.itch.io/texting-the-awkward-ace-guy-youve-had-a-crush-on-since-high-school\">Texting th<span></span>e Awkward Ace Guy You&#x27;ve  Had a Crush on Since High School by Carrot</a>\n<a href=\"https://carrotpatchgames.itch.io/save-the-last-dance\">Save the Last Dance by Carrot</a>\nCredits:Our Wonderland was developed solo along with the help of various third-party resources.Writing, art, design, and programming: Carrot\nMusic: Obtained from DOVA Syndrome, Audiostock, Epidemic Sound, and other various royalty free sources (full details included in game)\nSound effects: Obtained from Freesound.org (details included in game)\nStock photos: Obtained from Unsplash, Pixabay, etc.Additional code: glitch effect, kinetic text, particle effectAlpha tester: key\nBeta testers: HiroRCK, toydrill, Aural4444, Luea, MaroonDrops, Jam\n \n\nIf you haven't played Our Wonderland before: You don't need to do anything special! Just download the game and play from the beginning.\nIf you have played Our Wonderland before and have a save file to carry over:  Download the new [COMPLETE GAME]  version of the game and start 'er up. Probably, you won't need to do anything else (because Ren'Py keeps persistent save data from your games). However, if for whatever reason, you don't see any of your old saves, copy over the \"saves\" folder from your previous version of the game, and paste that into the \"game\" folder of the new version of the game.\nTroubleshooting\nStarting with the Arc 5 builds, the music files have been optimized. This means that if you have save files created on a much older build of the game (the Arc 4 builds or below), you may receive a Ren'Py error when loading a file that was saved at a point when a music file was actively playing. Don't worry, though—simply hit \"Ignore\" on the error screen and you'll still be able to use all your old saves just fine (they just will be music-less until the next music track starts in-game)."

    "Game Title": "IF - Underfell",
    "Game Description": "Welcome to Underfell.\nPlay as a customizable  \"Frisk\" who has fallen into Mt. Ebott: a mountain that houses a kingdom of banished monsters. These monsters resent and distrust humanity, most will attack any human on sight. \n\nYou have no way to climb back out: you can only move forward. \n\n\nThe story:\nLong ago, two races ruled over Earth: HUMAN and MONSTERS. One day, war broke out between the two races. After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell.\nThis was all part of your history class.\nThere are multiple monster kingdoms, although only one in your country—as far as history is aware—and where exactly they are sealed no one knows. One of the many mysteries lost to time.\nOr rather to war. Specifically the Great War which took its terrible toll on humanity. Since sealing the monsters centuries ago fewer and fewer humans are born with the ability to use magic. The Great War nearly wiped out the rarities that remained, and since the war, no other human has been born with the ability to use magic. \nWhich is truly a shame as the world is still filled with magic. \nHumanity is coping as best can be, but it is not an easy transition. What countries remain after the Great War are largely dependent on magic; switching to an alternative power source has been a struggle. \nThe last humans who can use magic are struggling to keep up with the demand, and their aging bodies only signal humanity's time limit. \nYou, like most of the population, cannot use magic. \nBut that’s okay!\nYou don’t need magic.\nYou have something else. Something even better.\nYou have you.\n\nThe romance (OPTIONAL - platonic / friendship routes are available):\nMAJOR - Sans (M) A crass skeleton monster who replaced his funny bone with a mean bone. He (reluctantly) works as a guard for several sentry posts. Be careful if you choose to trust him.  MAJOR - Papyrus (M)A confident skeleton monster who strives to meet the expectations imposed upon him (several from himself).He seems oddly... remorseful? MAJOR - Flowey (M)An anxious flower monster who agrees to be your guide in UNDERFELL.He doesn’t want to leave your side.MAJOR - Entity (???)👌︎☜︎👍︎✌︎🕆︎💧︎☜︎ ✡︎⚐︎🕆︎ ✌︎☼︎☜︎ ✡︎⚐︎🕆︎✌︎☠︎👎︎ ✋︎ ✌︎💣︎ 💣︎☜︎MAJOR - Harem??? ???????? MINOR - Grillby (M)A fire monster you encounter at Snowdin. He's hard to forget. MINOR - Mettaton (M) (Commissioned by Rory)\nA fire monster you encounter at Snowdin. He's hard to forget. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe credits / disclaimer: \nUnderfell AU was created by Vic the Underfella and is based off of Toby Fox's Undertale. This is a work of essentially choose your own adventure fanfiction written by me (Darkpetal16).  \nI just really, really wanted to play the game and I feel like it'll never happen unless I make it myself. \nThis is a PACIFIST only game & is complete!\n\nPlaythrough: \nPlaythrough by ★TwinklePhoenix★ on Youtube  - For those who want to listen & react alongside someone! This is a lovely first time play through. \nHarem playthrough by ★TwinklePhoenix★ on Youtube - For those who want to listen & react alongside someone! This is a fun playthrough. "

    "Game Description": "FAQ (Frequently asked questions)\n1. When will the game be released?\nPlease read this post. Thank you for understanding.\n\n2. Will the game be Free?\n\nNo. I still haven't decided what the price's going to be but after a lot of consideration I decided I'm not willing to make my games free anymore unless they're for a game jam or something along those lines. Making games takes a lot of time and money and I really can't afford to make everything I create free. \n3. Will the game be on Steam?\nThere aren't any plans for that, at the moment, sorry. As a creator from Argentina, my sales from Steam would be in Argentine Pesos and, honestly, the economy in my country is so bad right now that I can't really bear the cost of having sales in pesos. Especially considering that many of the people I hire for art, voice acting and other things are from overseas and I have to pay them in USD as well. \nThis might change if I ever move to another country some day... but for now, I really can't. Sorry.\n4. Will there be an Android port?\nMost probably yes! But not right away since these take a bit of time and I'd need to hire people to help me.\n~\nIf you have more questions, please refer to my  FAQ + General Information section on my Carrd first. It's very possible they might have been answered there already 🌸.

Thank you for understanding!\nReview, analysis/essay and recommendation videos are allowed and welcomed too!\nWARNING!\nWhile the game doesn't have any NSFW content, it's recommended for people who are 17 or older due to having strong language, violence, blood & murder. Player discretion is advised. PLEASE, be sure to read the TRIGGER WARNINGS and reconsider if this game is for you. Play responsibly.\n\nNote: Killer Trait is a mystery-thriller visual novel with elements of romance depending on the choices you make. The character you can romance is a man named Oz. The other 3 major characters, Arthur, Aslan & Carl are NOT romanceable and I have no intention of adding routes for them. \nIn Carl's case, though, while he won't be a love interest in this game, he WILL be in another one with a different MC. That game is for the far future, though, since I want to concentrate on my current projects, at the moment.\n✘  ✘  ✘\nSTORY\nYou've waited so long for this moment... \nFinally, after all those years of hard work in Silvering City, you'll realize your dream of becoming a police detective...! \nOr so you thought.\nBetrayed and accused of a crime you didn't commit, your only option is to join forces with a serial killer.\nWill you push your differences aside and work together to get revenge?

    "Game Description": "Tomorrow Will Be Dying\nA warm visual novel about finding yourself through your connections with other people.\n\n\nStory\nUnlike her childhood, B found herself often surrounded by people in her teenage years. Being the ace of Mokuzai High school's track team and having a prince-like demeanor, her classmates were drawn to her aura. She was practically the opposite of what others thought her to be: a reserved and old-fashioned individual that spent her days collecting and raising bugs. She soon found safety in the Occult club alongside others similar to her who all had strange interests of their own — A, the uncontrollable troublemaker, C, her neighbour that always had a tendency to daydream, and N, the mysterious leader of the club. However, by the end of their senior year, both A and N disappeared without a trace.\n\nAs the many seasons in B's life had passed, she had become accustomed to people disappearing from her life and succumbed to the whims of the moving world around her. Now, these parts that make up B's past and identity are washed clean, and she attempts to start anew and overcome the walls she has built around herself by her own hands.\nIn the present, B is a nineteen year-old entomology student pursuing her passions at Mokuzai University. She and C have gotten used to their daily life-styles with only each other as company, but their paths only truly start to set in motion when A and N unexpectedly crash back into their lives.\n\nFollow along B's story as she reconnects with old friends, makes new ones, and overcomes the traumas of her past.\n\n\nPrologue Features\n*Available for PC and Mac (with some caveats)!\nAround 10,000 words — Thirty minutes to an hour of reading depending on reading speed\nWhile not required for the full game,  the prologue gives a better picture into the high school life the Occult Club shared (and a few easter eggs may reveal themselves once you play the full story...)\nA small showcase of our new approach to narrative, as well as the new direction we've taken the characters in\nThe new UI - not only aesthetic-wise, but proper saving, loading, settings, auto mode, skipping — the basic mechanics are now much more stream-lined and clean in comparison to the original demo.\nThe sprites, backgrounds and CGs all have a visual style unique to the prologue.\n\n\n\nFull Game Features\nA story about loss and connection - A rich character-driven narrative with approximately 200,000 words, containing one main (and true) route, two sub-routes and 4 endings total.Day to day life - Manage B's stats — forge relationships, shop, cook — there's an array of mini-games sprinkled throughout. The route you take may be affected by what you do during free time events in-between story scenes...Art with an emphasis on atmosphere - Line-boiled sprites for each character, CGs that range from partial animation to fully animated sequences, and detailed backgrounds with variations for different parts of the day.\n\n\nFollow development!\nFull release - Coming soon\n    \n\n⚠ 4/27/2024 WARNING (Update)! The full release will be extremely different from the 2020 Legacy Demo with several plotlines dropped, different mechanics, and very different art and writing styles. ⚠ \n⚠ We've left it available for legacy's sake, but it is not at all a preview of the game, so only try it with this in mind! ⚠ \n\nSee the 2023 Dev Log for more info!\n\n\n\n*Mac 11.0+ (Prologue Only): Shouldn't need the quarantine process below.

Play as the deity of eternity, powerless and deemed useless among gods, for nothing lasts forever. A struggle between mortals and gods sparks a conflict that may bring an end to the age of the divine rule.\nYOUR CHOICES . Through the choices you make, develop character traits and skills that will define your player's identity and influence the course of the plot. You will dramatically change the outcome of the story through your own agency.\nThis game will be free to play in its entirety, and no necessary in-game content will ever be monetized. Updates may continue after the completion of the game as well.\nTumblr 🌿 Website\n\n\nYou are the deity of All That Lasts Forever, a being born of the Chaotic Universe and moulded in divinity. One that exists among gods of lore, with the power to change seasons, conjure great storms, and raise life from dust.\nYet, you wield no power. Nothing lasts forever.\nRelegated to an errand god, you assist the god of death with the afterlife, guiding lost spirits and hearing the dead's grievances.\nLife was simple; the gods weaved the starry night that mortals slept beneath, raised the sun that humans rose to and drew the tides that guided vessels along. All was peaceful.\nUntil someone dared to defy death.\nYour investigations into a strange occurrence will lead you to know far more than you ever intended to, unravelling what may be the precursor to the collapse of the reign of gods…\nAn outcast among gods and mortals, you are the grey area that bridges the two, and you will decide the fate of the world. Will you side with divinity, preserving power and maintaining order? Or will you support the struggle against them, ending a long era of oppressive rule?\n✧CONTENT WARNING: depictions of war, violence, and death; mentions of cannibalism (not heavily depicted) . Potentially sexually suggestive themes. 🌿\n\n✧ PLAY AS THE DEITY OF ETERNITY . 🌿 Though do not expect to be powerful or beloved, with nothing within your domain. Choose your own name, personality, \"gender\" and \"sexuality\". \n✧ FOUR CHARACTERS TO DEVELOP DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH . 🌿 Four characters to develop deeper relationships with. \n✧ A SHIFT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL NUMERICAL STATS . 🌿 Focused on immersive storytelling, make decisions true to your character, and develop complex relationships with characters that are not easily quantifiable. Your choices will seal your fate, rather than your skill at stat-raising.\n✧ DECIDE THE FATE OF THE WORLD . 🌿 Overthrow the current order of divinity, or fight to maintain the status quo\n✧ EXPLORE A WORLD OF MYSTIQUE AND WONDER, OF PAIN AND MISERY. 🌿 A sense of loss pervades\n\n✧ NOTE . 🌿 Gods canonically do not have a gender; merely their mortal forms will take on a certain gender presentation, which will be selectable.\n\nHumans have united under one rule, one civilization—Galaio (“one place”). A prosperous and thriving civilization where no one shall go hungry, forgotten or abused — free from the misery and pain of the war that tore the world in the past.\nGalaio is beautiful, with cities of gold and flowers, and villages of forests and hearth. Vines hug marble pillars, and trees line the streets. The earth has humans in her loving embrace, and the humans love the gods in return.\nDeities rule the humans closely, the space that once seemed vast between them now closed. They've grown wary of humans' ability to govern themselves—they must save them from themselves.\nAlthough many are comfortable with the idyllic lives they lead, they've become oblivious to the corruption and dissidence that grows within them — sentiments that cry for change. 🌿\n\n\n\nThis list will only cover characters you can form a deeper relationship with, platonic or romantic. All characters are available for everyone and gender presentation selectable. They are, by no means, the only important characters in the story.\n\nSALVATORE // Sal-va-to-reh. Deity of the sun, and the child of the goddess of the gods and goddess of mountains. They have a smile that lights up all their features, and radiates onto others like blessed sunlight. Vivid and cheerful, they possess a deep sense of duty to humanity, one they uphold steadfastly. Always earnest in their efforts, their optimism blinds others from the burdens they bear. Full portrait and character profile here!\n\nLUCIEL // Loo-see-el . Deity of death and one of the original Twelve gods. Their kindness belies their distance, preferring to keep others at arm’s length. They seem to be absent from all matters that concern both divine and mortal beings. Yet, their mere presence brings immutable peace, and you can confidently say they are the kindest of all the gods. Full portrait and character profile here!\n\nCIOCANA // Show-sah-na . Deity of misfortune and suffering, and child of the deity of natural disasters and goddess of the moon and stars. Their smile is charming and practiced, yet the corners of their mouth twist with mischief. Plagued by the role of their own existence, they manage to maintain their confidence, quick-witted and charismatic, yet biting and cynical. Though they're not well-liked among deities, this appears to bother them little. Full portrait and character profile here!\n\nALESSI // Al-ess-ee . The champion to free humanity from the reign of gods, child to human parents. Their easygoing smile is magnetic, inviting others to take a closer look like moth to fire. A natural leader, they are deeply attuned to the suffering of others and passionate about their cause. However, hidden beneath their friendliness is a righteous fury that consumes them from the inside and threatens to swallow their heart whole. Full portrait and character profile here!\n\nART CREDITS !\n✧ COVER ART . Thanks to Lenoka for an amazing cover!\n✧ BANNER . Thanks to nuavanxi for such a gorgeous banner!\n✧ CHARACTER PORTRAITS . Thanks to T0M0pann for the beautiful art!!\n✧ DESIGN .

Will you have any say in it? And how much will your relationship change?\nDevelop your personality, see how your choices build, and change your bond with Mathias.\nIt’s time to help him choose. Will your monarch Love the Guard or Be the King?\n\n\nFeatures:\n~104k words (3 out of 4 chapters developed + 1 Extra Story)Black & White aesthetic\n6 black & white CGs + 2 colored illustrations\nOne Love Interest with five possible types of branching relationships, non-romantic options included.\nPossible romantic rendezvous with other characters while in Mathias’s friendship route.\nLGBTQIA+ friendly + representation (you can choose your gender and your relationship with Mathias)\nAge suggested: 16+ for non-explicit sexual scenes, some soft swearing, and violence.If you donate $4.99 or more, you'll also receive the 2022 Artbook, filled with lore and more information about every character in the game! ;)\n\nAbout the game:\nThis game is my first prototype. I'm trying to see if I can give you the freedom to build your relationship with a character while also deciding how you feel about your past and present. \nOur experiences (and the way we feel about them) help define who we are, so, in this game, I'd like you to decide yours—and to face whatever consequences come with that choice.\nThis story will have 4 chapters. :) Right now, you have 3 out of 4 chapters + 1 Extra Story. If you want to support the development of LtGBtK, please consider leaving comments, following me, and sharing it with your friends! :)\nYou can also support me via ko-fi where I'll post more constant dev updates, lore, and extra content. :)\nAGE SUGGESTED: 16+ for erotic nudity and non-explicit sexual scenes.\nMain Characters:\nMathias Jan Yvanson (LI) - The Crown Prince - 28 - He / His \nYou and Mathias were raised together. As you grew up, he would often read for you, treat your wounds, and he honestly thought he was protecting you while your whole life went up in flames.Mathias is the future King of Opala, but something seems to be missing, and you’re not the only one who sees it. With Mathias being the target of a ravenous court, it’s up to you to give him the guidance and answers he needs—or to sit back and watch as the flames get higher. He may seem innocent and good, but there’s an underlying layer of guilt shaping his personality. Will you enforce it, break it, or use it in your favor?\nMandreis Jay Yvanson - The Grand General - 26 - They / Them \nMathias’s sibling and the-child-who-didn’t-have-a-whipping-boy. Like you, Mandra was also a victim of King Elias’s punishments, and it shows in the many scars they carry.Everything Mandra does has a reason, and no matter how reckless, rude, or violent they may be, you can be sure of one thing: they’ll have Mathias exactly in the place he should be, one way or another. Mandra was once the child who ran after you and Mathias. Today, they’re the Grand General of the Opalean Forces, and the symbol of everything that could’ve gone right—but didn’t. Their intentions? Not even the Goddess knows.\nQueen Yvana Jal Yvanson - THE Queen - 53 - She / Her\nThe Queen was the one responsible for bringing you into the Castle, decades ago. She used to be sweet and good while you were growing up, but something changed and nobody knows exactly what. Now, as the Azure Taint consumes her, Queen Yvana seems to slowly go back to her former self. Be careful, though. Her gentle countenance hides secrets that go much beyond the black cherry wood forming her crown.\nDoctor Helena Filtchen - The Spymaster The Royal Doctor - 56 - She / Her\nBrutal when needed, incisive when asked, and always paying attention. Some people might think her long-lasting, romantic relationship with Queen Yvana left her too soft to keep acting in the shadows, but Dr. Filtchen is always ready to prove them wrong.She’s now focused on studying the Azure Taint and on finding a cure. If she’ll find it in time or not, that’s another story.\nMaster Mercurio - The Great Arcanos - ??? - He / Them\nNobody knows exactly where he comes from, but “Master Curio,” as Mathias has always called him, is possibly one of, if not the most powerful Arcane Mage in all the Five Kingdoms. Nobody knows why or how Master Curio chooses their students or how many they are, but he is in Opala now to train Mathias—and he better not waste the opportunity.\n… And YOU! - The Dragon Commander\nChild of a lesser bourgeois, you were raised in the Castle with everything a royal child could have—plus a painful coating of scars that mask your back, arms, nape, and face.Build your own Dragon Commander, your relationship with Mathias and the others, and discover the past that binds you all, so you can stir your present in the direction you want… and maybe decide the future of the entire kingdom.\nAbout the dev:\nWriting stories that welcome you home. Brazilian, 90's kid, panromantic, demisexual, interested in all things artistic.\nLigia Nunes is an award winner writer, Visual Novel Developer, feminist, queer, and Brazilian Latina born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. At the same time writer, illustrator, translator, and terrible karaokê singer, she's the type of supervillain who's decided to dream big and conquer the word. Ligia puts her characters to play, battle, and fall hopelessly in love in megacities built with the dark corners of countless cities as bricks, technology as blood, and Brazilian folklore as soul. When she’s not wickedly plotting against her main characters—or making them pine for one another—she’s developing games or searching for the perfect pistachio ice cream.\n\nDid you enjoy the game?\nIf you enjoyed yourself, please consider leaving a comment telling me what/if you liked the game, or maybe just share it with a friend! <3 Donations are also appreciated, but spreading the word helps a lot too! :3\nDon't know what to tell me? Well, here's a few questions:\nWhat's your favorite character?Did you try the different options, or did you follow only one path?What do you think of the black-and-white aesthetic?Is there anything about the world of Five Kingdoms you'd like to know more about while playing?"

    "Game Title": "Scratchin' Melodii (Beta Demo)",
    "Game Description": "Scratchin’ Melodii is a rhythm game about self expression!\nInspired by the classic roots of the rhythm game genre, repeat or remix beats to find your own groove in a radical Funk & Hip-Hop adventure!

(Jan. 2025) | Scratchin' Melodii Devlog\nMost Recent Demo: Christmas SAGE 2023 Demo V1.033 (Jan 19, 2024)Please note that there will not be anymore demos or demo updates. At this point, I'm only working finishing the full game. The contents of this demo do not represent the final game, as this demo is of an older build of the game and was released mainly for testing and feedback purposes. Many things are more or less finished than others, in no particular order.\nYou can get the soundtrack here!: https://lj-lephemstar.bandcamp.com/album/scratchin-melodii-ost\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.scratchin-melodii.com\nThis demo features:\n6 playable songsIf you played the last version of the demo, you'll notice that the Vocaloid tuning and/or vocal mixing has been redone for the returning songs!\nCream Cheese IcingNami.WAV\nStir & Mix\nGrease Poppin'\nSupastar TennisSidechain Fever\nThe first Act of the game's Story ModeStory Mode has been almost completely redone since the last demo! Now taking place in a new more cinematic 3d environment.How To Play\nAll of the gameplay happens on the Rhythm Tracks.When the line is blue, you'll see your opponent's icon start moving as they lay down a beat. After they're done, it's your turn to respond to that beat using the available buttons shown on the Rhythm Track. The start of your turn will be indicated by a controller rumble and Melodii's icon beginning to move,\n\nWhen the line is pink, Melodii will have their own unique set of available buttons to press. The start of your turn will be indicated by a controller rumble and Melodii's icon beginning to move.\n\nAt the start of each turn, only Rhythm Tracks being used for that line will light up.For example, this is a Double Line, so both the top and bottom tracks are lit up. Double Lines use both Rhythm Tracks and are played from top to bottom.\n\nScoring Meters\nRhythm - This will increase every time you gain points from being on-beat with the song. To stay on-beat, line up your button presses with the beat dots and stars on the Rhythm Tracks.Expression - This will increase every time you gain points from remixing the suggested line using the available buttons.Obedience - This will increase every time you gain points from following the exact button order and timing of the suggested line.Expression is much more valuable to your score than obedience, so really try to mix things up when you can! Have fun!\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\"How do I freestyle/How does the Expression meter work?\"\nHere's a full guide! https://lj-lephemstar.itch.io/scratchin-melodii/devlog/653636/scratchin-melodii-...\n\"Why isn't my controller working/mapped right?\"\nThis usually either happens because another program is interfering with the game's native controller support or because you're using an unsupported controller.\nOther possible solutions: \n(If playing natively)\nMake sure Steam, DS4Windows, or any other program that affects controller input isn't running in the backgroundMake sure your controller is player 1If you're using an NS Pro Controller natively, try using it wirelessly\nIf none of that works, you may be using an unsupported controller.

Though you had a life, dreams, and aspirations once, it all got swept away once you were diagnosed with an incurable disease; now you're stuck in a hospital, living the last few weeks of your life in pure agony, unable to process this horrible fate that befell you.\nEverything changes when, one day, you're approached by a scientist from the world's largest corporation, who offers you a chance to escape your dying body and have your mind transplanted onto an android \"Synthetic\" vessel; the only catch being, nobody knows whether the process works or not, whether you'll survive the Transition or ultimately perish.\nWith little holding you back, you ultimately accept...\n\n...You awaken in your new body, feeling quite different from how you were before. Nobody can tell whether it's truly you inside the machine, or an AI pretending, believing that it's you.\nNot even yourself.\nIn a world where technology's constantly evolving, advanced AIs are viewed with fear and suspicion and few things are certain, you have to rebuild your old life from scratch, convince those who abandoned you on your deathbed that you're still here, and ultimately figure out whether you truly are who you claim to be.\nAbout the game:\nNMF is a linear Sci-Fi Visual Novel where you'll explore a high-tech futuristic world as an android, meet all sorts of new people and reconnect with some old faces, and try to find the truth behind your existence and your purpose in this new world.\nThe game addresses heavy topics such as death, suicide, depression, anxiety, and existential dread. If you are suffering from depression or are easily overwhelmed by these topics, I advise you to exercise caution when reading the contents of this VN or refrain from playing altogether.\nThe game is entirely SFW, though there are some adult non-explicit jokes thrown in for comedic effect. There aren't, nor will there ever be, any explicit scenes or suggestive content in this VN.There are fight scenes in the novel that feature non-graphic depictions of violence.Updates will be irregular, but regular progress reports will be made through Devlogs here on Itch, through my Twitter, and lastly through my public Discord server. You can also check out my Patreon and especially my Ko-Fi!

One moment you were in your room sleeping and the next you were walking through smoke and ash trying to find your parents.\nLove, he said, was the reason he started the war. Ironically, you lost everything you loved but you also lost yourself when he let you survive and dragged you away to his home.\nIn a new Kingdom with no one on your side what choices will you make to survive? Who will you become?\nInside of you there’s something burning for revenge and there’s only one thing I want to tell you.  Let it out.\n\nThe story starts in the Kingdom of Vesphire, a fictional kingdom within a fantasy universe, but it truly begins in the Kingdom of Rosea.\nThe two kingdoms are situated in a world that was blessed by the gods, the lands were filled with magic and beasts of wonder. For unknown reasons the gods abandoned the realm taking everything they had brought with them while the beasts moved to forests and the sea. Anywhere that was far from civilization.\nYou were born and raised in Vesphire until tragedy struck and you were taken away to Rosea. Contrary to the snowy lands of Vesphire, Rosea was tropical in the north and temperate in the south with mountains surrounding the lane.\nThe Kingdom is a colorful land with green scenery contrasts to its large white buildings. The streets are always busy from early mornings to the late nights, and filled with  calls from the shopkeepers from their wooden stalls with sun-faded striped fabric or blue tarps above it. It is truly a lively place.\nThe ruler of this kingdom is none other than Luceris De Rosea. He is the man who led destruction right onto your home, he is the one whom all of Rosea admire. The land is  immensely beautiful but many of its people harbor great hatred towards you due to you being the last royal of Vesphire.\n\n✧ Play as the royal of your own making:\nName [including nicknames]\nGender [male, female and nonbinary options]\nPronouns [choose a preset or set your own]\nPersonality [develop personality traits that will influence event sequences and the behavior of other characters towards you]\nAppearance [including scars and tattoos]\n✧ Develop deeper relationships with the characters, each with their own themes and stories, and find romance if you wish for it.\n✧ Build rapport with characters from all over the continent, aid them with their problems or use them as a pawn in your story.\n\n✧ Build a codex as you explore the world that surrounds you; encounter people, places, history and magic.\n\n✧ Encounter important timed choices with alternative results if time runs out or you choose to abstain.\n\nContent Warning: This game is rated MA-17.

While all characters are available to everyone, only Hunter is gender selectable. It is important to note that these characters are not the only ones of significance.\nFadiya Akter - The Royal Mage’s daughter, and one of the only people that doesn’t have something against you. She’s cheerful, talkative and kind - like a fairy. Fiercely loyal to you, to the point that she gets into trouble just to defend you even in court. She is a powerful mage just like her mother. She is one year younger than you.\nHelios De Rosea - The Crown Prince of Rosea, and the child of the man that destroyed your home. He has a radiating smile that instantly brightens up the room, like sunshine itself. He is the hero of all fairytales, the boy with a golden spirit full of light and hope. He keeps his distance from you, after all you are the last royal of Vesphire. He is one year older than you.\nHunter Oakes - Crown Prince’s shield and Sir Lancelot’s ward. Easygoing, resilient and reckless; their serene smile puts everyone at ease. They’re loyal to the hand that feeds them but understand what you went through was an injustice. They are four years older than you.\nSoarine De Norazaan - Eldest daughter of the King of Norazaan, and an envoy to Rosea. Her smile is charming and practiced, she has a vixen-like personality. Soarine wishes to take the throne and better her kingdom, her desire for the throne is underlined by a thirst for revenge against the people in her kingdom who have forgotten their own history. She is one year older than you.\nVincent Annora - Son of the current General of the Imperial Army and the one who will take her position in the future. The perfect example of what a knight should be. He is very guarded and passionately protective of the people he cares about, he may seem rough around the edges but has a gentler side to him at times. He dislikes you due to his mother’s own hatred towards you and your late family. He is two years older than you."

Chapter Two releases for all other routes will be coming soon.This game features a soft-route-selection approach. The route is chosen during Chapter 1 at the Wheelhouse, with the option to switch routes to a character who appears shortly after.\nFor progress information, follow the project at @DawntideVN on twitter.\n---\nRiley's spent his whole life in Porthwarren. He flows with a steady pace, drifting from one part-time-job to the next. As certain as the tide rolls in and out, Riley's resigned to the ebb and flow of this routine. \n\n\nHe's grown up with a good group of friends, but time and circumstance has brought distance between them. Ranzo works abroad on cargo ships, Billy studies north of the County, Sal has made herself busy with freelance work and Joe's settled into his cloistered museum job. Like the old boats that sway in the harbour, memories of the group's better times are moored loosely, and risk drifting off for good.\n\n\nWalking familiar paths around the town, Riley is reminded of somebody he clung to like a rock in stormy waters. Someone outside the group. Someone he'd loved. Though after ten years apart, memories of him are painted in fading watercolour.\nAs cool Spring air breathes life onto the land, the town prepares for it's yearly folk festival. With Billy on break from university and Ranzo catching a ship to port, it's the perfect time for a reunion. However, with this year's festival marking a special occasion, it may draw in more visitors than anticipated.\n---\nDonations are apprecciated and will assist in the continued development of the project, but are not required to play.\nThis story uses strong language and makes reference to topics such as alcohol, sex & drug use. It is intended for 18+ audiences.---The current release of Dawntide now has an official Chinese translation by 恩维, which can be downloaded here."

And if you haven't played TBoI or Plants vs. Zombies yet, you should buy n play them right now.\nMost of the sprites and effects were made by me, but I still used many assets from TBoI: Rebirth (for which, of course, I do not take credit) to give the game an authentic look. The game's also uses various OST written by Ridiculon (with the exception of the wonderful \"Drowned Sorrows\" track by Nicolas Mayer), as well as many sound effects from these games. Playing the game further you'll find some epic cameo-characters, referencing various mods and other members of the Isaac community.\nThe game is deep in alpha, which means that it's kinda playable, but it doesn't have much content yet. I still have a lot of ideas, so expect more content in later updates. \nWell, I hope you enjoy it!\nControls/Hints:\nCollect hearts and buy babies to fight monsters. I mean, why not.B. Bobbies shoot tears at enemies, Little C.H.A.Ds produce more hearts, Cubes of Meat can be used to protect other babies, and Bob's Brain used to deal with strong enemies and remove obstacles.Using Space Bar you can speed up/slow down the game (just like in PvZ 2)You can also use 1-4 keys to grab babies, Q key to grab a shovel and E key to grab an active item (without dragging your mouse around the screen every time)\n\n\nMy Twitter: Doctor_Hummer\nMy Discord channel: Starbox\nMy Boosty (if you wish to help me financially, for some reason) : doctorhummer\nAnd check out a fan-made I.RULE wiki (также есть раздел на русском языке!)Ruler.IRule is an installer and updater for I.RULE made by precious Tomat. This program will keep your copy of I.RULE up-to-date as the game updates. Using this program is simple, just download and extract the .zip file to a permanent location, then open Ruler.IRule.exe. When this program starts, it will give you some time pick between choosing the latest version or choosing an older version manually. After a version is chosen, it will be installed if it was not installed already, and will then launch the game. \nThis requires .NET 6, which you can get here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download (Get the Runtime, not SDK)\nIf you don't wanna use the installer, you can still download updates manually without the tool.\n"

    "Game Description": "\nZorlok is an interactive fiction game following the bizarre misadventures of a demon with no memories and the nerdy high schooler they're bound to serve. Uncover mysteries and cause mayhem in this dark comedy about monsters, found family, personal identity, and the line between good and evil.\nThe setting and story are inspired by campy horror movies, classic murder mysteries, and an old Monster of the Week campaign. The first demo release was on May 13th, 2022. The most recent update was a prologue re-release on March 2nd, 2025.\nWarning: Zorlok is rated 17+ for swearing, alcohol and drug use, sexually suggestive content, violence, self-harm, discussions about religion and mental health, and death. \n\nYou were a terrifying demon who wielded hellfire, fought angels, and corrupted souls... At least, you think you were. You can no longer be sure, not since you made a deal with Tommy—some nerdy high schooler willing to sell you his soul to become cool.\nThat should have been easy, right? If anyone can bend and manipulate the minds of pathetic humans, it's a ruler of Hell. But, no! Before you could even begin, Tommy accidentally made you forget your past (and all because he wanted to call you \"Zorlok\").\nSo, now you're Zorlok. A demon, sure, but a demon with no sense of self and no clue what the hell being a demon means—you don't know why or how you became like this, how to control your infernal powers, you aren't even sure how these pacts are supposed to work. \nBut who are you now? Truly? With your memories and identity stripped away, where does that leave you? You are a demon, but are you still demonic?\n\nAnd just in case your amnesia and subsequent identity crisis weren't enough, you've gotten involved with a group of monster hunters working for a local fey council. Now you and two random humans are supposed to protect the city of Casper from vicious predators, investigate strange deaths, and fight off \"evil.\" Whatever. \nYou're just glad to get a break from doing Tommy's math homework.\n\n- Embrace the chance to redefine yourself or attempt to regain your former identity \n\nUncover the secrets of your pastCustomize your gender, pronouns, and identityDesign your human vessel and gradually unlock a more demonic appearanceChoose an alias and pass yourself off as a \"regular human person\"\nName your loyal hellhound and select what animal it's disguised as\nContinue to rail against your situation or decide that maybe this isn't so bad\n- Learn to control your infernal powers and choose the three domains at your command: either Fire or Ice, either Sight or Spirit, and either Corrupting or Shifting\n\n- Tell elaborate lies or risk unveiling dangerous truths\n\n- Watch Tommy's personality change as a direct result of your influence\n- Help Tommy survive high school (or sabotage him at every turn)\n\n- Explore Casper, WA—a strange little city either surrounded by or inhabited by monsters (depending on who you ask)\n\n- Set everything on fire... accidentally\n\nTommy Osorio\nThe 15 year-old you're forced to help who accidentally made you forget your past. Once Tommy becomes \"cool\" you'll probably regain your memories, but after learning what that word means to modern humans, you're starting to wonder if this is an impossible task. To read more about Tommy click here.\n\ncis male (he/him)\nThe Hellhound\nYour faithful \"dog\".

Like most citizens, A/E isn't aware of magic's existence, but they have their suspicions and realize more's going on here than meets the eye.

Ainsley is an incredible hunter who's spent most of her life dedicated to this craft, earning great respect from her community along the way. She comes across as warm, welcoming, and caring (almost too much so?) and, given the way she treats you and Ciel, Ainsley doesn't seem to hold any prejudice against monstrous beings. For more on Ainsley click here.\n\ncis female (she/her)\nLucía Reyes\nA member of Ainsley's team. Lucía is a park ranger, an impressive feat given that the forest surrounding Casper is \"infested\" with monsters. As far as you can tell, something has drawn her to this forest, but you don't know if she's looking for something or hiding from someone. Lucía keeps her secrets tight to her chest and most people at the business end of a notched arrow. For more on Lucía click here.\n\nRO: cis female (she/her or they/them), lesbian\nCiel Renault\nThe last of the rival team members. Ciel is a mystery to you—an acerbic, hot-blooded, goth mystery to be exact. They appear human at first glance, but the longer you look at them, the more you notice strange features: yellow eyes, pointed ears, short fangs, and a conspicuous bite mark on their neck. You don't know exactly what Ciel is, but they certainly aren't human. For more on Ciel click here.\n\nRO + Gender Customizable: nonbinary (she/they) or nonbinary (he/they)\nDanny\nAn unlucky soul that crosses your path.

    "Game Title": "Sinners and Saints",
    "Game Description": "You live in Deadwood, an old town forgotten by the world, as it is isolated by thick forests, a river and a mountain. It is one of those places that trap their residents, if you don’t get out as youth, you will likely never leave. It also has the reputation for attracting the weird and morally questionable. You had the misfortune of being born here, not only that — you work here as a detective. Granted, you only got the job a year ago or so, but you are the authority.\nNow, many things start to happen all at once. Your best friend is acting more and more strange, an attractive and charming stranger moves into the town and starts to fund the mayor’s projects and takes an interest in your division. Your criminal informant is keeping secrets from you. You’re assigned a partner — one that would rather claw your eyes out than say ‘hi.’ A old friend from your past comes rocking your world in the most unpleasant way, and as strange murders start taking place — a vigilante comes to clean up the streets by any means necessary. The cherry on the top is when your captain orders you to take on a consultant on the case - the local psychic - whose first words to you make the whole world spin.\nWork the case of strange murders, with the help of unlikely allies. Find the secrets of the newcomers and old friends from Deadwood and your own -- one you didn’t even know you had. Discover the second side to your home town, one that you never saw before. Choose what kind of detective will you be; one who bends the rules, or follows them. Romance any of the seven characters, or make them your friends, rivals or enemies. (You can select the gender of each Romantic Option, and there are 2 polyamorous options.)\n\nFEATURES:\n\nCustomizable Main Character (or MC); you can customize how they look, their pronouns, gender (including trans options), sexuality (including asexuality and being aromantic), ways to deal with stress (smoking, fidgeting) and whether MC is comfortable or uncomfortable in crowds--more customizations will follow in future updates!\nBefriend, romance or make an enemy of any of the 7 characters from the 'main cast'; each romanceable character is gender selectable and there are two possible polyamorous options (for Khari & Morgan, and Sage & Ariel).Decide whether your Detective will be the one to follow the rules or break them.Learn the secrets of the town's locals, your old friends, and coworkers.Build or break relationships with secondary characters.Uncover the mystery surrounding the main character--even though you might not think there is one.\n\n\nNote: Romance is completely optional in game and all romanceable characters can as well be the MC's enemies or friends, or stay neutral depending on choices in-game.\n\nROMANCEABLE CHARACTERS:\n\n“Just looking at you makes me thirsty, Detective.”\nSasha is your new Criminal Informant. You met them as they were working the street. When you were arresting them, they flirted with you the entire time, and they continued doing so during the booking process, as well as when they were finally in their cell. As they complained on being bored, they suggested working for you as a criminal informant. You agreed, and now they help you stop the crimes in Deadwood. As they work the street, they see a lot of what is going on and their knowledge comes at a price. For now, it’s always been reasonable, but you couldn’t help but wonder — how long before they become hungry for more?\n\n\n“You had my interest, love, but now you’ve got my attention.”\nSage came to Deadwood from a big city, officially for a change of scenery, unofficially the whole town gossips about the real reason why someone so attractive, educated and rich would choose Deadwood of all places as their home. Sage has a close relationship with both the mayor and police captain, as they invest in many city and police projects. Extremely charming and seductive, Sage is one of the hottest topics in town — and fate would have it that they are looking forward to meeting the Deadwood’s youngest detective.\n\n“I can respect your fire, little feather, but mine will get you burned.”\nAriel is a vigilante, taking justice into their own hands. As judge, jury, and executioner they rip through the crime in Deadwood, using questionable methods to achieve their goals. Legally, you can not tie them to anything, and they know it. Whatever mission they have — they are willing to die and bleed for it, and do not care for any human aspect of life as they do it. They do seem to respect you to a certain level, or just ignore your existence, as long as you stay out of their way. But what if you don’t?\n\n\n“I work alone, kitten, I don’t make any exceptions, not even for you.”\nKhari is your most recent headache, as they are your new assigned partner, and new to Deadwood as a whole. You know nothing about them, and they don’t exactly make it an easy job to work with them, as they would rather fight you and everyone in their line of sight. They do not like you and make it very clear from the start that they do not care for a positive relation with you. They prefer to work alone, and tend to keep it that way. But, you wonder, if there’s a chance to change that?\n\n\n“It is good to have a little magic on your side, is it not?”\nRoan is local good-luck charm, and coincidentally your best friend and your first kiss. You attended high school together, and went to prom as a date, on which the kiss happened. Neither of you spoke about it, however, and continued to be just best friends. They are always there when you need them, always text back, pick up the call from you, and never turn down a hang out session. You’ve seen them date many people after high school, but no one ever stayed for long, as Roan would always say they are looking for ‘the one.’ You can’t help but wonder, how would things be if you became something more?\n\n\n“You make me want to go feral, and I just might let it happen.”\nRiven is your childhood best friend. They used to live in the house next to yours, and would always sneak into your garden to escape their home. You never found out what made them want to run away — they never told you, and you never saw their parents nor the inside of their house. As a child they were quiet, even submissive, always wanted to please you and be on your good side, loud noises and too-fast movement made them flinch. They were, however, restless and would not sit in one place at the time, always multitasking, fiddling with their fingers, taking things apart only to put them back together. They were fiercely loyal to you, as much so that they were suspended from school for beating up a person who bullied you. When you were both 14, they disappeared along with their parents. Did they move and never said goodbye? Did something more sinister happen?\n\n\n“The only happy ending we will get will be after our death, Detective.”\nMorgan is a consultant, and assists police on more ‘strange’ cases. Most people of Deadwood call them the ‘Psycho Kid’ and prefer to avoid all contact with them if it’s possible. You’ve heard stories about them, it’s impossible not to. That they died as a child and now have a permanent connection with the other side — so much so that their own mother abandoned them as soon as she could, too scared of her child to stay with them. That they live in a haunted house full of spirits, and talk to ghosts, even see them all around. You never witnessed them doing anything too suspicious, but then again, you never worked with them, yet.\n\nTUMBLR | DISCORD SERVER\n"

There are no mysterious deals to fear, and the figure who seduces you into an alley at midnight is certainly no malicious spirit.\n\nWhich luckily for you means easy prey.\n\nSince you’ve gained consciousness, you’ve known the mortalis are responsible for draining the world of its magic and creating the Arids, the wastelands that have overtaken the continent.

This story's main themes are platonic bonding and character developement during the span of many years. As such, you will be able to interact with the ROs both romantically and platonically, with relationships that will evolve during your years spent in Camelot.\nFollow my Tumblr blog for updates and further informations about the project or its character. If you enjoyed my content and you'd like to support it, consider making a small donation on my Ko-Fi page. In any case, your interest and support is more than enough to make me an happy author.\nTUMBLR BLOG // KO-FI \n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nYou are the King’s spouse, his right and left hand, the unstoppable executor of his will. Your name is whispered by enemies and allies with fear and respect alike, some says it’s your arm that bears the weight of the entire kingdom.They call you the King’s hound. It started as a way to taunt you but it’s not that far away from the truth. Your loyalty is blind, your devotion absolute. The King’s vision is your vision.Your name will forever mark history alongside theirs.But for now, you are being shipped to your betrothed, alone and powerless on your way to Camelot.As the seventh child of the Venegard House, you’ve always had little to look forward to other than an arranged marriage to achieve a political alliance. That’s exactly why, after your parents lost the rebellion against King Arthur, you were the one sent to him as a sign of newfound peace.You don’t know what awaits you now, but after you Camelot will never be the same.\n\nLOVE INTERESTS\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Arthur (he/they pronouns)\nThe noble, compassionate and fair leader of Camelot. Protective and respectful, Arthur is going to give you as much freedom, space and support as you may need. Play your cards right and, if you choose to be their spouse only by name, they’ll become a very supportive wingman. No matter what you’ll be to them, you are enchanted by their vision from the moment you understand what they are fighting for. You know you’ll stand by their side no matter what. [25yo]\n\nKnight Yniol (M/F/NB)\nOne of the knights at the Round Table, almost 6’6” (2.00m) and the only one who fights with a spear, Yniol could be intimdating at first, but only to those who do not know how much they care for every single one of you. Composed and focused, they are the most gentle knight you’ll ever have the pleasure to meet. They’ve had their eyes on you from the moment you first arrived to Camelot and, close or not, you are now under their protection. [26yo]\n\nKnight Evaine (M/F/NB)\nThe most mysterious knight of the Round Table. You know they hide something under that carfree attitude because their façade craks most often than not. They recover fast, but every time their eyes are lost in the void at your shoulders a bit longer. They treat you like something fragile and delicate but maybe that’s the care they need themselves. Despite what some other knights say about them, they are not careless at all. In fact, all their movements and words are carefully measured, expecially around you. [24yo]\n\nThe physician Morien (M/F/NB)\nThey are the caring, if a bit pragmatic, physician of the Round Table knights. Reserved and, at times, abrasive, they bear in their eyes the horror of a war that should never have happened. Despite this, or maybe because of this, you feel like they are one of the only one who can understand what you’ve gone through. They could become your most trusted confidant or, if you want, you could be for eachother the support pillar you both desperately need. [27yo] \nYour personal servant Gwyar (M/F/NB)\nThey are the one who’s been tasked with assisting you, and they have all the intention to make you feel comfortable and secure under their care. Born in the wild lands, they have traveled many miles towars Camelot in search of a future at court. Understanding, even while mantaining the proper distance, they will remain composed and mildly humorous until you show them signs of your interest. Expect them to be one of the most flattering and tender of all the ROs.

Or, you could always direct your affections to more than one person (there are four total poly routes available).\nBecome a living legend, your King’s most loyal shadow or his fiercest commander.

As such there will never be an official physical demo disc release however we provide a diy kit as a download to make your own. There's also been some confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on any sort of hardware from the time.

If you are going to play all routes anyway, I suggest starting off with Zeikun or Sachiro as an introduction to the story. Kurato and Junoru routes are more plot-heavy so I’d do them as last. If you enjoy keeping hooked on mysteries I suggest this order: Sachiro> Zeikun> Kurato > Junoru. To understand hints given in other routes I suggest this order: Kurato > Zeikun > Sachiro or Junoru.  After reaching any normal/romantic ending of other characters, it unlocks an extra scene at the ending of Kurato.\n\nMain Cast\n\n♦ Heroine (re-nameable) — A bored girl who seeks mysteries.♦ Zeikun —  A rude and straightforward man.♦ Junoru— Quiet and mysterious gentleman.♦ Sachiro —  A lost boy who asks for your help.♦ Kurato — Despite his cheerful personality, the heroine questions his intentions.\n\nLinks\nOfficial Site — Development blog and info about the game.Tumblr — Mostly doodles and short notices.Twitter — Doodles, notices and fan creations.Discord chat Server—  Chat with fellow players and staff.\nFull walk-through by Emi\nFull walk-through 2 by Alice\n\nYou can report bugs and script errors here: \nhttps://forms.gle/gt5Lt8JvfbA12yH8A\nIf you enjoy the content, please support us!

    "Game Description": "\n\"Everything is going to be OK\" is a desktop labyrinth of vignettes, poetry, strange fever dream games, and broken digital spaces. It is a collection of life experiences that are largely a commentary on struggle, survival, and coping with the aftermath of surviving bad things.On the surface it comes off as dark comedy, and humor is a prevalent theme, but as you interact the themes start to unravel and facilitate, what I hope to be, a deeper discussion about these topics.I call it an interactive zine because it's broken, painful, beautifully terrible, and profound on a very personal level. Nothing about this is fiction, although the themes are abstract enough so that anyone can approach it and find it relatable.It is a very personal \"game\", and I view it as something other than a game. Through-ought development I had been struggling with the \"game\" label, and toxicity that calling something like this \"game\" brings in, which I documented extensively here (or on my blog). There is also a good interview here about these issues... As a result, I feel like calling work like this a game might do it more harm than good.\"Everything is going to be OK\" is something to experience without game expectations. Its spaces, pages, and environments, are built to be explored.It most certainly doesn't exist for the sole purpose of entertainment, and if you are looking for something small, lighthearted and fun, this might not be it. It is a very different type of experience.\nYou can read the full Artist's Statement here.\n\"Everything is going to be OK\" has appeared in a number of festivals, and publications... such as Indiegames.com, PC Gamer, Wired, Mashable... and winning IndieCade's Interaction Award, and AMAZE's Digital Moments...

    "Game Title": "Lost in Limbo [Demo]",
    "Game Description": "\n\nWhen you finally quit your dead-end job and move back to your mother's house in the ever-peaceful town of Faybourne, you think things could only get better. However, the moment you set foot in your childhood home, a harrowing nightmare long forgotten appears to haunt you once more. \n\nA tower that crumbles in the vastness of a bleeding sky. A voice that mourns and yearns for something.\n\nTorn away from your peaceful life and thrown into a world of danger and deceit, you are at the mercy of the Seven Sovereigns of Limbo. Navigate the Realm Between as it faces an impending cataclysm that threatens to swallow you and those you love whole.\nAs the consequences of a plan set in motion long ago start to unveil, will love be the key to your freedom, or the first chapter of your downfall?\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain every CG, we reccommend playing the demo twice and testing different options! \nCONTENT WARNING\nLost in Limbo is rated +17. Beware of flashing lights, disturbing imagery, mild horror, mild jumpscares, implicit and suggestive sexual scenes and discussions, sensitive topics such as toxic family relationships, anxiety, depression, depictions of alcohol / drug use, etc.\n\n\n\nGod and creator of Limbo, Father Pride watches over the peace and well-being of his realm, but the life of a god can be solitary. When he welcomes you with open arms, his kindness draws you in...and a perturbing omen makes you stay.\nVA: Patrick 'Pat' Langner\n\n\n\nUnapologetically so, Lord Amon lives his life to the fullest and indulges in as many pleasures as he can. His dissarming personality could put anyone at ease, but the Golden Dragon is not as harmless as everyone wants to believe.\nVA: Brian Vaughn\n\n\n\n\n\nDedicated and brave, Praefectus Raeya takes her role as Limbo's protector extremely seriously, but the truth behind the realm's darkest times will soon put her loyalty —and her ability to keep you out of harm's way— to the test.\nVA: Silvairre Devereaux\n\n\n\n\nPronounced [ɡaˈel]\nCurrent Master of the Grand Houses, Gael’s sweet and noble persona won the hearts of the citizens of Limbo and has ensured his position for the past five elections. However, the beloved Master has a secret that could end his reputation and plunge his already torn city into chaos.\nVA: Abi Kumar\n\n\n\n\nStripped of their name and shunned after committing treason, the Sovereign now known as Lord Envy lives a life of solitude and confinement. Will you be able to break down the walls they have built around themselves for centuries, or will you remain a prisoner in his castle for all eternity?\nVA: Aaron Moy\n\n\n\nKind and caring, Ara is not only determined to make your time in Limbo a happy thing to remember, but also to make things go back to the way they were, no matter the cost. Her dazzling smile hides an ambition and a determination that could serve you well—if both your goals are as aligned as she swears them to be. \nVA: Zaria Weems\n\n\n\nAs the youngest Sovereign, no one expects anything from Xal, not even himself. He is seen as a good-for-nothing and a poor excuse of a god, but you two are about to prove everyone wrong. For better or worse, he's the only one who can help you, but what if Xal needs you as much as you need him?\nVA: Francfil Pontañeles\n\nOur first demo will feature...\nThe first version of Lost in Limbo's prologueCustomizable first name, last name and pronouns of the MC (she/her, he/him, they/them) or use a default name; River Winchester.Over ~42k words (around three hours of gameplay)\nAnimated backgrounds!Partial voice actingSeven CGs (one per character) + mini-CGs to enhance the experience!Over 25 different choices (some of them timed!)\nTo obtain every CG, we reccommend playing the demo twice and testing different options! \nTHIS DEMO WILL BE AVAILABLE ON PC, MAC, LINUX AND HOPEFULLY ON ANDROID! \nThe android version may come later than the PC one, but we'll work hard so you mobile folks don't have to wait too long!\n\n\n\n\n\nRavenstar Games is a four-person indie developer studio based in Valencia, Spain, formed by lifelong friends with a passion for videogames and a single dream; working on what makes us happy by creating the games we want to play.\nMAIN TEAM\nSeyl (any pronouns) — Director, writer, programmer, sprite artist\nRaquel (she/her)— Lead sprite artist, CG artist, background artist\nAstro (he/him) — Background artist, creature artist\nKayden (he/him) — Background artist, mini-CG artist, concept artist\nBUT WE COULDN'T DO THIS WITHOUT HELP!\nAiryn (she/her) — Background artist\nAllie Vera (she/they/he) — Editor, proofreader, beta tester (and our holy savior)\nRe.Alice — UI design, Logo design\nDark Fantasy Studio — Music\nCrescence Studio (they/them) — Emotional support and beta tester\nCallum Sanders as Mysterious seer\nAJ, Narjs, Ela, Dort — Beta testing\nAnd of course, a huge thanks to all our supporters and followers, because we wouldn't have made it this far without you all! \nPlease note that this page can be subjected to changes in the future.\n\n For MAC users, please download the instructions below if you are having any trouble accessing the demo.

    "Game Description": "Get the official soundtrack here!\nSigns of the Sojourner is a narrative deck-building game about connecting and communicating with others. It breaks away from typical card-battlers by instead challenging you to understand different perspectives and navigate social situations.\nYour deck is your character, shaped by your experiences and relationships. Different decks will lead to different narrative paths as your cards impact your ability to communicate with various characters. Rather than building the most \"powerful\" deck, you will have to make decisions about who you want to be in this world and how you relate to others.\nSet in a near-future earth-like world, you take over your mother's store after her death, traveling to diverse locations in order to acquire goods for the shop. This is a world where communities are more insulated, where travel is difficult, and where climate change has made life hard, but you'll still encounter optimistic stories, compassionate characters, and delightful surprises.\nWhere To Find Us\nEchodog Games Discord server\nEchodog Games website\n@EchodogGames on Twitter\nSigns of the Sojourner on Steam"

Some users have found success using the Game Porting toolkit.\nLINUX: Unfortunately, the game is hasn't been compiled for Linux yet, but will hopefully be soon. Some users have found success emulating the game using Lutris/Wine.\n\nLatest version: There is only one unified version now! Just download whatever is below. Last updated: 2023-09-17 (1.0.4 Patch)NOTE: All other download sources are unverified and potentially unsafe.What about Mac or Linux?\nThey are probably coming eventually.\nTo install a new game version:\nYou don't install this game with an installer - it is \"portable\", meaning you instead get a folder that you can put anywhere on your computer, move it whenever you want, and the game won't be affected. All custom maps, custom textures, miners, profiles and settings are saved in external folders (maps are saved in the Documents folder).\nNevertheless, here are the instructions on how to play the game on a PC:Prerequisites: First, make sure your computer can unpack compressed Zip files. If you can't, or aren't sure how, I recommend downloading and installing the free program \"7Zip\" https://www.7-zip.org/. WinRar is another decent alternative. After you have done this, please follow these steps:Step 1) Download the game .zip file you've chosen and find it on your hard driveStep 2) Right-click the .zip file and choose \"Unpack to ManicMinersV1.0\". You may find this under the \"7Zip\" menu after right-clicking if you installed 7Zip.Step 3) The game is now placed in a folder next to the .zip file. This folder is portable, meaning you can place it anywhere on your computer. Your levels, profiles and miners are saved in a \"global\" folder, and will remain even if the game folder is deleted.Step 4) Open the folder and double-click the .exe file to run the game.Step 5) If you are having problems, try out the shortcuts in the AlternateVersions folder next to the exe. They are shortcuts to run older graphics versions, basically. If you still have problems, please connect to the Discord server and ask for help in the #troubleshooting channel. (Discord invite: https://discord.gg/C3hH7mFsMv)\nNote: Your antivirus might mark the game or zip as suspicious. Don't worry, I've played it myself and it's safe.\nTo update from an existing game version:\n\nFollow the instructions above again and just place the game in a new separate folder. Never merge the files into an existing folder, as that can cause conflicts leading to crashes. Deleting an existing game folder will not delete any of your save files or levels and is fully safe to do at any time. I recommend deleting old versions of the game entirely so that they're not overwritten by old data. To play older builds, please refer to the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/manic-miners-archive\n"

    "Game Description": "\n\n\tOnce upon a time, there was a lonesome Recluse, plagued with the desire to raise a child. Wandering nearby, the strange Witch of the Woods overheard this wish, and with a twisted humor gifted them a pot of dirt. Help guide the Recluse through the maze of fungal parenthood, then discover how many types of person (mushroom?) your Daughter can become!\nWhen one Daughter falls, start over and discover new corners of the world... and a treasure trove of secrets and unlockables!\n\n\n\n\nRaising a child is hard, raising a mushroom is no easier. Any little thing you do can change your Daughter's path in life - will she grow into a pretty little Fly Agaric or an uncanny and indomitable Cordyceps? A parent's role is key, so take it seriously... or perhaps you'd rather relax. There's always next time, after all!\n\n\n\nThe world of Mushroom Musume is fun and unusual, full of whimsical moments and unexpected dark corners. Discover shocking new outcomes and twists in familiar events by playing again as a different Daughter. Choose alternate paths, and gain a more complete picture of this odd world. Perhaps even spend time in a tale-within-a-tale and see the world through (slightly less) fungal-colored glasses...\n\n\n\nYou can find almost any color in fungi, and that's true of your Daughter too. Collect memories of Daughters past, colors, music, and more in your own personal Mushroom Almanac. With tons of treats to discover, foraging for everything could take years!\n\n\n\nMushroom Musume is filled with...\n\n    180,000+ words of story\n    Hundreds of photographs and illustrations\n    Over two hours of beautiful and haunting music\n    ...So please, take a seat and enjoy your time spent as a mycological parent!\n\n\n\tNote: Mushroom Musume is still in active development!

The Crumbling Foundations Update is out now! ~\n\t\n\tAfter six months of polish, we're proud to announce a new update featuring doomed daughters, cruelty, and revenge (oh, what fun!)...

    "Game Title": "Ballads at Midnight",
    "Game Description": "\n\n When a sarcastic bard is arrested and exiled to an abandoned castle, she expected to be at the mercy of a hungry, blood-thirsty vampire. She soon discovers that the vampire, Lucius, is not starving: he is gravely bored. She may just survive on borrowed time, one ballad each midnight.\n\n\n\n(The name can be changed)\nA well-traveled and gifted bard. Abigail is quick-witted and quick to act, though not necessarily in that order. Sarcasm coats her words like calluses, formed through years of undergoing difficult journeys and indulging difficult people. While she has a strong sense of insight and genuine interest in others, she has a dogged impulse of announcing her observations. This is seldom appreciated, and at worst has led to face grave consequences.\nStill, no one can deny that she has a flair and talent for entertainment. Not even a centuries-old vampire.\n\n\n(Love interest)\nOne's first impression of Lucius is that he's menacing at worst, and witheringly unyielding at best. However, his coarse exterior is a thin veil for his impressively dry wit - which he's more than happy to reveal if he thinks his sense of humor will be heard. It's rather hard to share one's wit when your guests generally scream and run at the sight of you though.\n\n♦ Enemies to lovers, found family, bonding through shared trauma, and even more of your favorite relationship tropes! \n♦ A dark fantasy romance that seamlessly blends lighthearted moments and hidden depths, with believable dialogue and an abundance of banter. (Boy, they love to argue. ;p )\n♦ Beautiful sprite and original music\n♦ Three clearly-marked endings - abandon him as early as possible, remain in eternal bliss or discover gruesome secrets about the world around you.\n♦ Flavor line choices: be an unabashed flirt or have a razor sharp tongue. The choice is yours, no consequences.\n♦ More than 42 000 words (around 3-4h per playthrough)\n♦ Partial voice acting & two original bard songs!\nBallads at Midnight is rated T for suggestive material, strong language, alcohol use, and allusions to trauma, child abuse, and fantasy violence.\n\n\nAyael (Director, UI designer & programmer, scripter) - Arrapso (Sprite, background artist),  Wudgeous (Lead writer, narrative designer), Notafish (Writer), Jeneara (Editor), Rowanty (scripter),  Eliana Zebro (Audio & voice director), Shar Joyner (composer), Megan Youmans (Voice actor - MC), Eric Navarro (Voice actor - Lucius), Kimi (Trailer creator)\nThis game was created in one month during the NaNoReNo 2022 jam.\n"

    "Game Title": "Softly, Opulent",
    "Game Description": "Softly, Opulent is a dark fantasy romance, an interactive fiction not suited for those under 17. \n\nThe Queen dies the night you’re born. And your family locks you away.\n\nAll of King Adder’s children are a mystery to the common folk, but you—you are nothing but a ghost. A ghost, that spends eighteen years locked away in the deepest part of the palace, so that no eyes may lay upon you.\n\nAnd those that do—they do not treat you kindly.\n\nAnd when you are finally of age, at last, you are betrothed to the child of the King of a far away kingdom, to secure an alliance that your father has been seeking for years.\n\nAnd you are swept away to a place even more foreign than your own land, to be wed to a stranger that looks at you with contempt. To live in a kingdom of citizens that despise you. \n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, fight a war.\n\nContent Warnings: Softly, Opulent contains many upsetting themes, such as: arranged marriage, child abuse, child neglect, assault, death, murder, suicide, sexually suggestive scenes, and more. Viewer discretion is advised, and this story is only appropriate for those 17+.\n----\nCustomize your main character. (Name, Pronouns, Appearance, Personality.)\nRomance one of four characters. (All of which are gender selectable.)\nOvercome your past trauma. \nBefriend many side characters.\nLearn magic, learn how to fight.\nPossibly overthrow your father, the tyrant King.\nAttend balls, and witness the viper pit that is high society.\nFight an undead army.\n\nRomantic Interests.\nThe Betrothed, Aleksandar/Aleksandra. (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) - They are the heir to the throne of Aslerea and your betrothed. But it’s the last thing they want to be. They seem to hold something against you. They are serious and spend hours upon hours training—they’re preparing for something. Their engagement to you is quite the hinder, but can you make them see it differently? Their duty blinds them, but you can change that.\nThe Pirate Captain, Rhys/Rhea. (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) - They are a mystery. They are a pirate—the very embodiment of freedom and sea, yet they choose to remain in the kingdom of Aslerea more often than not. They stand to gain something by being there, but you don’t know what. There’s something in you that tells you that you can’t trust them, but their smile is so pretty, and their flirtation so constant that you want to. But maybe—just maybe, if you play your cards right—they will treat you as tenderly as their dearest treasure.\nThe Shadow, Calixta/Calix. (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) - They are your betrothed’s younger sibling, and so no one pays quite as much attention to them. Though they seem content in their sibling’s shadow—content with their lack of responsibility—you can’t help but wonder if there’s more to it. They are as lazy as a bump on a log, and they likely sleep more than anything else—but there’s an interest in their eyes when they look at you. Is it something deep, or just a longing to claim what their sibling has? You could find out.\nThe Tutor, Mestra/Mestrn. (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) - They are assigned as your tutor and tasked with the great undertaking of making you fit to lead. But they are also close with the people in the palace, and help the servants when they can. They know commoners by name and spend nights in the tavern, surrounded by free drinks. And while they are kind, there is something beneath it all that suggests a person that will go far to protect those they care about. Whether it’s because of their kind nature or something else, they have no enemies.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the story or characters, or just simply following the development of this story, go to my Tumblr, here."

    "Game Title": "The Good People (Na Daoine Maithe)",
    "Game Description": "\nThe Good People (Na Daoine Maithe) is a lore-rich and choice-driven historical fantasy visual novel inspired by Irish mythology and Celtic folklore. Play as a tenant farmer from mid-19th century Ireland, whose path becomes inexplicably entwined in fairy affairs after getting robbed by the roadside and lured into the mythic and war-torn world of Tír na nÓg: A once unified land, now divided into the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. Will you escape and return home with your stolen belongings? Or does fate have something else in mind?\n\nWhile trapped in this strange and storied land, you meet six members of the Tuatha Dé Danann (\"Tribe of the Goddess Danu\"), split evenly between the rivalling Seelie and Unseelie Courts. Who will you trust, befriend — romance? In either case, you'd best be careful. Fairies are a capricious sort, and liable to pull you into their own agendas...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Click images to enlarge text)\n\n\n\n🍃 The Good People (Na Daoine Maithe) is a Kickstarter-funded project currently in development. Due to the scope of the story, we will be releasing it serially over several years at a discounted price. The earlier it's bought, the cheaper it will be overall, and you'll only need to buy the game once! Regional pricing is also available on our Steam listing.\n🍂 Not all routes are currently available! As of Nov. 1, 2024, you can play half of Shae and Maeve's routes; both approximately 50k words. If you're not sure about paying for an unfinished game, feel free to check out our free demo first. It consists of Vol. 1, Book of the Traveller (the pre-route content). Differences between the demo's Vol. 1 and the paid game's Vol. 1 are marginal following our August 1, 2024 re-release of the demo.\n🍃  The Good People (Na Daoine Maithe) has a recommended reading order (Vol. 1, then 2, then 3, etc.), which will correspond to the release order of the routes. For more information on our reasoning behind this, click here.\n🍂 Due to its setting, The Good People (Na Daoine Maithe) will occasionally feature instances of characters speaking in Gaeilge, i.e. the Irish language. All instances of Gaeilge are linked to an internal translation tool, which is voiced by Nigel McKeon, a Gaeilgeoir. \n🍃 The main character is yours to shape. At minimum, you must choose a nickname, pronouns, and one of four default appearances, the last of which can be your own artwork (instructions are included in the game's files). You may also choose to discard the True Name...\n🍂 All routes, both current and upcoming, will have both romantic and platonic choice options. If you're uninterested in romance, feel free to make friends instead! No matter the nature of your relationship, you will still be able to reach the good end. Or the bad one.\n🍃 Our cast consists of two men, two women, and two non-binary characters. All are romancable no matter the MC, but some characters are asexual or on the aromantic spectrum, which may impact aspects of their romances. \n🍂 If you are a Mac user and are having issues launching the game via the Itch direct download, refer to this guide for troubleshooting before posting a comment. We strongly recommend purchasing the game through Steam instead of Itch if you are a Mac user; it is the best way to avoid issues with launching the game. \n🐎 There are secrets to be found in this game, with more yet to come. Prepare yourself for a lot of horse related shenanigans. \n\nThe Good People (Na Daoine Maithe)  contains subjects and themes that may be upsetting to some players,  including discussions and depictions of war, famine (including the Great  Famine), abuse, fantasy violence, and mild blood. This list is subject  to update as necessary.\n\nIn  Vol. 1, MC will  be referred to as \"they/them\" due to a case of mistaken identity. It is  not intentional misgendering and will be corrected in the routes.\n\n· · ·\nWebsite · Patreon · Ko-Fi\nBluesky · Tumblr · Discord\n \n "

    "Game Title": "Eye of the Moon",
    "Game Description": "Recovering from the consequences of a divine war, the pantheon of Kaluwalhatian adjusts to the shared rule of Mayari, the peacekeeping goddess of the moon, and Apolaki, the trailblazing god of the sun.\nAs the deity of lost things, you occupy yourself with discovery and exploration, using your gifts to guide the mortals that pray to you and to find forgotten treasures. But when the truce between the rulers of Kaluwalhatian begins to splinter, deity and mortal alike call on you to restore the balance.\nWill you make your greatest discovery yet, or will you succumb to the forces threatening to tear the heavens apart?\n\nEye of the Moon is an adventure and romance story inspired by Filipino mythology. Written by a Filipino woman, this interactive fiction game is a labor of love about protecting your home, complicated families, and relying on each other.\nFeatures:\nan immersive world exploring the Philippines and its rich indigenous mythologies\nin depth character customization including appearance and personality\nromances that are integral to the story, with two bisexual love interests and a poly route\nchoices that influence the story and your relationships, with multiple possible endings\n\nEye of the Moon is a work in progress and will be released chapter by chapter. Follow the game blog for the latest updates and extra content. If you're enjoying the game, you can send me a tip either here on itch.io or on Ko-fi! \nUpdate status: Chapter 2 released on April 10, 2022. \nTotal word count: 38.9k\nOfficial art by borgdraws.\nNote: This game is rated M for language, violence, and sexual content. It will eventually include optional explicit content.\n\nEye of the Moon is set in Kaluwalhatian, the realm of the deities in Filipino mythology. As the deity of lost things you will travel all over the heavens, exploring the Philippines' most majestic landscapes and visiting the mortals on earth when your adventures require. \nThe story is immersed in pre-colonial Filipino culture and history; it purposefully sheds Western concepts around gender, sexuality, and religion.\n\nWithin the game, you'll set your pronouns and choose your love interest(s) but gender and sexuality are completely up to your headcanon! You'll also be able to customize your Moonfinder's appearance and personality.\nThere are three main personality archetypes in Eye of the Moon; these affect the Moonfinder’s overall demeanor.\nBlue: charitable and sympathetic\nPurple: playful and mischievous\nRed: aloof and exacting\nThere are also two other variable traits. These have more to do with how the Moonfinder handles social situations and conflict resolution.\nProactive/reactive\nDiplomat/fighter\nThe proactive/reactive trait also affects how the Moonfinder approaches romance.\nPlease note, the Moonfinder is not a blank slate MC! You can find an MC guide including clothing references and setting appropriate names here.\n\n\nEye of the Moon features two love interests: Tala, goddess of the stars and navigation and Dumakulem, god of the mountains and hunting. You can pursue them individually or simultaneously through the poly route!\n\n\nTala pierces stars through the night sky, turning them into brilliant jewels that guide mortals through the dark. It is said that every time a new deity is born, Tala creates a new constellation in the ocean above to welcome them to Kaluwalhatian. Mortals worship her because without the stars as their map they would be lost in the seas.\nDuma resides in the mountains on earth, teaching and protecting the mortals within his domain. He is one of the most revered amongst the pantheon because of his reputation as a provider: of sustenance, of guidance, of endurance. Whether hunters are still learning to notch their bows or are tracking down the most elusive of prey, Duma is the recipient of their prayers."

    "Game Title": "Misplaced",
    "Game Description": "\nLast Updated: February 14th (Chapter 9)\nMisplaced is a fantasy romance IF wherein your choices not only determine your own fate, but that of an entire kingdom. Let me take you on an adventure filled with both whimsy and tragedy alike.\nThe current public demo goes up to the end of Chapter 9.  Follow me here  or on tumblr to never miss a new release.\nThe demo on Patreon goes up to the end of Chapter 10.  I appreciate any and all support immensely. \nThe character art you see above was done by Katie Palmer Illustration. Consider checking out her other art on her tumblr or on her instagram. \n\nFor decades, the human kingdom of Gaiapeia has been in conflict with the fae living in the surrounding lands. There's no end in sight - in fact, an outright war seems more likely with each passing day.\nYou are the child of Lady and Sir Grahm, a noble family who has been serving the crown for generations. Eager to follow in your father's footsteps, you have been training for years to become a knight worthy of being Prince Az'Lean's Champion - his right hand, his closest confidant, the one who protects his life from the growing danger of the fae.\nWhen the time finally comes and you are chosen for the position, it's a dream come true. You couldn't be happier, but just one day later on your 21st birthday, a terrible truth is revealed to you.\nYou are a changeling - a fae child that was smuggled into a human family with only one purpose: to gain the prince's trust and use it against him.\nA war between humans and fae is slowly but surely brewing, and the outcome depends entirely on your choices. \nWill you choose a side or try to make peace? \nWill you embrace what you are or reject it? \nAnd who will you let in on your secret?\n\nCustomize the appearance of your MC, play as non-binary, female, or male and romance whoever you like however you like, including the option of asexual or queer-platonic relationships.\n\nEnjoy the story without having to worry about stats - you will be a competent knight no matter what. There is no failure or success, only different choices and their outcomes.\n\nShape your personality, and your trustworthiness, with your actions. How other characters feel about you will change depending on how they perceive you.\n\nPick a side early on, play the long con, or refuse to make a choice at all. There are multiple split paths that will feature the same romancable characters - but their relationship to you might vary greatly (including villain romances).\n\n\n\nVynn (nb): A fellow knight and your best friend\nUnlike you, Vynn isn't a knight by choice and doesn't care much for fighting. They'd much rather be a bard if they could, seeing as they love playing the lute, spinning epic tales, and generally being a source of levity. They are fiercely loyal and good-natured, though there is that bit of resentment that will never quite leave their heart.\n\nAz'Lean (m): The prince and the one you are sworn to protect\nAt a glance, Az'Lean is the very picture of a fairytale prince: charming, chivalrous, and powerful. He is an excellent fighter, loves animals, and prefers to be treated like an equal. Anyone who cares to look will soon notice the darkness lurking beneath that shining exterior, festering ever since the death of his mother.\n\nMaeve (f): A powerful dryad and your teacher on the ways of the fae\nMaeve is usually playful and soft, though she can get eerily intense at times. As much as she cares about decorum and courtly things, she finds joy in the simplest pleasures and easily turns into a giggly mess. For all her humour, you can never quite tell if she is being serious. Sometimes it feels like she's just playing with you.\n\nThianne (f): A sorceress and one of Az'Lean's most trusted advisors\nThianne is intelligent and hard-working, though sometimes at the expense of her own well-being. Although she comes across as abrasive and rude, she is always willing to help those who need it. Her dry sense of humour and brutal honesty have endeared her to just as many people as they have made her enemies.\n\nLester (m): A half-fae and servant in the castle\nAs with most half-fae, Lester's presence isn't entirely welcome, and his reasons for being here seem deeper than he lets on. Lester is known for his mischief and his crude humour, often pulling pranks that border on malicious. Despite the way he presents himself as laid-back and uncaring, it's clear that there's a lot he isn't opening up about.\n\nThis story contains potentially triggering content. There will be graphic depictions of violence, death, discrimination, body-image issues, mental illness (including panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and paranoia), discussions of genocide, war, and terminal illness. \nDiscretion is advised. More warnings might be added at a later date.\n\nThe character art you see above was done by Katie Palmer Illustration. Consider checking out her other art on her tumblr or on her instagram. \nIf you would like to view biweekly update posts, participate in polls, and get access to monthly short stories, consider supporting me on Patreon.\nI apologise if any of your old safe files aren't working anymore. This is a work in progress and it is always possible that they are no longer compatible with the current version. \n\nPlease try not to spoil anything major in the comments!"

It was created in just under 1 month and was the first game I made using Naninovel x Unity, so it was pretty tough trying to finish something to upload in time for the jam deadline while also learning how to use a new engine. The original jam version of the game can still be downloaded. Since then, I have made numerous changes to the current version to better reflect my future vision for the project :3\n\n\nAs always, there are bound to be some small bugs! Aaaand, I'm unable to test the Mac + Linux versions, as I only have access to Windows, so it's entirely possible that those versions don't work >.< I will do my best to fix any bugs encountered anyhow :3\nPlease use this thread here to comment on any bugs that you find :D\nNeed help getting the game to open on Mac?

Without strife, aspirations and ambitions were sullied, and people soon turned to despair... until an old pastime, Yugioh, bore fruit.\nAt first, it was just a fun activity that gave meaning to a dull world.\nYet, it eventually gave rise to classism, as more and more positions in society, even government, were determined by a person's ability to win a duel. Great duelists lived lavish lifestyles. Likewise, people that sucked at Yugioh or had bad decks were outcasts and ostracized into homelessness and poverty. Even killed.\nAfter centuries of this, one terrible duelist decides to take a stand...\n\nand enlists the help of his best friend, a super hacker with unrequited feelings...\n\nYour goal will be to win all 8 of the largest tournaments to qualify for the playoffs... but watch out! Evil forces lurk, plotting behind the scenes... and they will stop at nothing, be it fair means or foul!\n\n\nRig your deck. Complete puzzles. Buy property.\nCan YOU become the Cheater Lord?!\n\n(Disclaimer: As the game is more story driven... no card database exists, and duel gameplay will not be too interactive.)\nThere's one more surprise in store, a special in-game item...\nDiamonds! Collect 1 red, blue or green diamond and you will receive $100 via PayPal! \nTo qualify, you must be the 1st to collect a red/blue/green diamond and then beat the game; for instance, if someone else claims a red diamond, nobody else can claim a red diamond. I'll keep you all updated on each diamond's status.\n(Your claim must also be proved by providing a screenshot and save data.

He must work with his squadron against any threat that comes his way lest he falls to the I.C.O.\nI.C.O. is heavily inspired by anime such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Attack on Titan, and Gurren Lagan which have greatly shaped the design and story being told. I do hope however that I.C.O. is able to carve out its own identity and hopefully be something fresh and new in the furry VN medium.\nThe project is intended to be fully SFW but will feature potentially triggering topics such as death, gore, and trauma. \nSupport Me!\n       \nI.C.O. requires a lot of art assets and time to make and by supporting me, I can have people make the VN even better and allow me to focus on writing the story I want to write! \n\nColoring of characters and promotional material done by the lovely Cody Opulos! Check his twitter out here.\nArt direction, concept art, and BG/CG work done by Jasper Huxley.\nhttps://twitter.com/JaspersArtVault\nMusic and sound effects composed and designed by Hughhhh.\nUI and programming by Dusty 닿스티.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallenVn\nIf you enjoyed I.C.O., please give these other games a stab!

    "Game Title": "The Blind Griffin",
    "Game Description": "\t\tThe Blind Griffin is an otome game developed by Asphodel Quartet for NaNoRenO 2015. Our team is made up of artists Auro-Cyanide and Rins, writer/programmer Lorelei, and composer/musician Noyemi K. The game features three different character routes (Giovanni, Alexei, and Emilio) and has 10 different endings. The game is free with a pay-what-you-want system in place for people who'd like to leave a tip.Trigger/content warnings for mentions and/or depictions of: death, execution, suicide, drug use/abuse, alcohol. We recommend that players be at least 13 years of age to play this game.PURCHASE THE ORIGINALSOUNDTRACK HERE!S T O R Y\tIt's the roaring 20's. Alcohol-loving Americans are chafing underneath the restrictions of Prohibition, but speakeasies have thankfully risen to fill the void with ill-begotten booze. The Blind Griffin is one such speakeasy in San Francisco, California, but it's about to go out of business...because its employees are a den of magicians who are more concerned with their magical studies and experiments than moonshine! Desperate not to lose the building that has become their haven, they hire the first streetsmart guttersnipe they find with some experience to help turn things around, but could she perhaps turn out to be the strongest magician of them all?\tC H A R A C T E R S\t\t  \t\t  \n\t\tGIOVANNI (GIO) // The speakeasy's premier violinist. He moonlights as a saxophone player but he's awful at it (nobody tells him). The laid-back older brother of the group and widely regarded to be the strongest magician of the coven, Gio takes the safety of the group as a whole very seriously. Specializes in earth magic.\t\tMARIE // The owner of the Blind Griffin. She was disowned by her high-class family because of her gender identity, but is allowed to keep the building provided the business turns a profit. Cultured and delicate, Marie is unfortunately a busybody for whom money seems like it's water. Do NOT make comments about her height.\t\tALEXEI // The displaced nobleman. He and his family were part of the Russian imperial court, but had to emigrate to America after the revolution. Though he acts cold towards people he's unfamiliar with and comes off as blunt and awkward at first, he is actually kind at heart and easily flustered. Specializes in water/ice magic.\t\tEMILIO // The working class baby of the group. Emilio is the most junior member of the coven until the heroine arrives. His family runs a small bistro, but they barely make ends meet. His bad experiences with non-mages have put a chip on his shoulder and added fuel to his already hot-tempered, megalomaniacal tendencies. Specializes in fire magic.\t\t??? // The heroine. The youngest child of a large Chinese family, she had to make herself useful from a young age and thus never received any formal education. She is practical, street-smart, and no nonsense. For some reason, she hates her actual name so she goes by a nickname (that the player sets). The extent of her powers is unknown.\t\tVIVIENNE (VIVI) // The songstress. A city slicker originally from New York, she saw Bessie Smith performing live once and was so totally star-struck that she decided right then and there that she would put her all into becoming a singer. Vivi is bubbly and sweet-natured, but also quite headstrong. Specializes in air magic."

We haven't updated it since the end of 2017 and have no plans to do anything else with it, but here it remains for posterity (or a crude introduction to what the game's about).\nIf you're interested in more, click the image below to be taken to the full release on Steam!\nPUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT\nPlease don't post about the Steam version here, not when there's such a lovely space to do that in the Autonauts Steam Community. This itch.io space is dedicated to the prototype only. Cheers!\n\n\n\n•••\nThe latest stable Autonauts prototype is 21.2, with or without lighting depending on your video card :)\n\nThe Change Log for all versions to date can be viewed HERE.\nWho or what are the Autonauts?\nThe 'Automationauts' (to give them their fuller, granderer, longerwindederer title) travel the universe with the sole goal of setting worlds in motion through the power of automation.\nThey harness whatever natural resources are available; they learn fast and can eventually make pretty much anything from anything. But their most important creations are workerbots, which can be made from the crudest of materials and taught to do anything an Autonaut can do so they can get on with helping species evolve.\n+ + + AUTOWORK IN AUTOPROGRESS + + +\nThis pre-pre-pre-Alpha release is lacking refinement and presentation - and it can take some getting into - but under the rough edges there's a great example of what we're doing and where we're going. If you like what you see, play and automate here, check out the full version on Steam!\nHow to Play\nUse a combination of mouse and keyboard.\nWASD or SHIFT+RMB or Middle Mouse button to pan the camera around.Mousewheel zooms the camera in and out.LMB tells your Autonaut where to go and what to do.LMB also picks things up and makes things happen.RMB drops things.Z can be used for some things like instruments and signs.Space blows your whistle so you can get the attention of workerbots.I brings up your inventory: what's in your hands and your backpack; you can drag and drop objects between slots - and even trade with your workerbots. Holding Left Shift and clicking an object will automatically swap between hands /inventory or player/bot., and . (< and >) cycle forwards and backwards through your inventory (to swap the item in your hands)./ or Q stows the held item (assuming there's space in your inventory) so you can use your empty hands for other tasks.H brings up the 'Hot Bar' so you can quickly swap items between your hands and your Inventory.E brings up the Edit Menu, which is where you choose what to build; note that some things can only be built on flooring.R rotates building blueprints clockwise, so you can choose which way they face.RMB deletes a blueprint; DEL (fn-backspace on Mac) allows you to delete buildings once built (but only while in Edit Mode).Esc pauses the game and brings up the Pause Menu, from where you can save and load progress.C toggles 'Free Cam' on/off. Use WASD to move around, Q/E to move up and down and Left Shift to move faster; the Mouse Scroll Wheel zooms in/out; Up/Down Arrow changes movement speed.X recentres the camera on you.\nIn this basic world you will find earth, sand, sea, fresh water, clay, rock, trees and cereal - and the resident folk, who are content to sit around in the buff, doing nothing.\nAnd speaking of nothing, that's exactly what you start with. But from these humble beginnings you can build and automate an entire civilisation. Well, you can when the game's further along; for now you can only start a forestry and cereal farming, and provide shelter and food for the folk.\nYou can also make and teach robots how to do anything you can do, which is aces.\nPlease Note\nAutonauts is so early in its development that we won't be able to guarantee the compatibility of saved games between versions (but we will do our best to minimise issues).\nAlso, the Linux version is still untested by us (because we don't have Linux) but feedback so far suggests that it's working well enough, so we'll keep supplying a Linux version with every update :)\nHandy Quickstart Guide\nSo, yeah, this guide may well be creaking around the joints but it's still valid and useful :)\nPick up a Stick, pick up a Stone and build a Crude Axe.Chop down some Trees.Go to the Edit Menu (E) and select 'Simple Flooring' blueprint; place two Simple Flooring blueprints down side by side.Build the Simple Flooring by putting Logs into it.Call up the Edit Menu again and select Crude Bench Saw blueprint; place one on the built flooring.Build the Crude Bench Saw by putting Logs and Planks into it (use your axe to chop Logs to make Planks).Add a 'Worker Assembler' blueprint (which doesn't need to be on the Simple Flooring).Use the Crude Bench Saw to make Planks and Poles for the Worker Assembler.Add a 'Basic Workbench' blueprint (you might need more Simple Flooring) and build it.Click the Basic Workbench and change it to output 'Crude Gear.'Stick a Plank into the Basic Workbench to get a Crude Gear out.Add the Crude Gear to the Worker Assembler along with Planks and Poles to make your first Workerbot.Press Space to whistle and select your Workerbot. Click 'Trade' and put an Axe into its hand (you'll also need an axe for yourself).Click 'Teach' then chop a tree; click 'Repeat' and then 'Go' to get the Workerbot started.Sit back and enjoy watching your Workerbot chop trees forever (well, until its axe breaks).Now automate EVERYTHING!\nIf you still get stuck, don't forget to check out our YouTube playthrough of the first version from a million years ago, which we really really REALLY ought to update soon.

    "Game Title": "Caves of Qud",
    "Game Description": "\n\tCaves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through a layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?\n\nWho are you?\n\n\tPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes—the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\n\n\n\tYou arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra'yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud's jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky.\n\n\n\tYou clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmer—he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, \"Live and drink, friend.\"\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n\tAnything and everything. \n\tCaves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.\n\n\n\tAssemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects, 24 castes and kits, and dozens of cybernetic implants—outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourself—it's all the character diversity you could want.\n\tExplore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locations—each world is nearly 1 million maps large.\n\tDig through everything—don't like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.\n\tHack the limbs off monsters—every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.\n\tPursue allegiances with over 60 factions—apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beings—just to name a few.\n\tFollow the plot to Barathrum the Old, a sentient cave bear who leads a sect of tinkers intent on restoring technological splendor to Qud.\n\tLearn the lore—there's a story in every nook, from legendary items with storied pasts to in-game history books written by plant historians. A novel's worth of handwritten lore is knit into a procedurally-generated history that's different every game.\n\tDie—Caves of Qud is brutally difficult and deaths are permanent. Don't worry, though—you can always roll a new character.\nWords about Caves of Qud\n“There’s a sense of magnificent history to dredge from its depths.” -Chris Priestman, Kill Screen\n“Caves of Qud is one of the best roguelikes in years, packed with evocative prose and featuring a captivating world of arcane secrets to explore.” -Heather Alexandra, Kotaku\n“Narratively, this is one of the most compelling game stories that I’ve seen in a long time.” -Charlie Hall, Polygon\n“Caves of Qud has a particular kind of New Wave science fiction imagination that just can’t be beat.” -Cameron Kunzelman, Paste Magazine\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack can be purchased here: https://freeholdgames.itch.io/caves-of-qud-soundtrack"

    "Game Title": "Liar Liar 2",
    "Game Description": "The sequel to my first game Liar Liar : Liar Liar 2: Pants on Fire\nContinues one year after the game left off, Yukari and Miho are now high schoolers, who are now dating and spend their leisure time together holding hands, kissing, and murdering the occasional boy or two. On one day just like any other, a new transfer student arrives to Yukari's school. It's Koshi Tanaka! But wasn't he dead? Apparently not. The goal of the game is to figure out the mysterious circumstances of Tanaka's revival and most importantly, staying alive. \nTrigger Warnings: Blood and Gore (an example of one depicted above), Violence (a majority of it is implied, but include, forced amputation, implied torture, throat slashing, and stabbing) mentions of stalking, eye strain (like the first game it is fairly bright), sudden noises and the screen shakes occasionally\nI worked on this with a strict deadline of a week as opposed to five days this time, and I'm proud to say it's much longer. The true route should take you around 20-30 minutes to complete! Unfortunately, the story is pretty predictable (and cheesy too haha) and quite linear, there are probably a bunch of things left unexplained and a lot of stuff I wanted to include (that didn't make the final cut) I have learned my lesson I will probably write out the script instead of making stuff up as I go next time haha. I hope you guys have as much fun playing it as I had fun making it! "

It is currently being re-written and ported over from Choicescript. This demo only includes Chapter 1 but will be written to match the original game demo's length of five chapters. \nThis is a story about people and the choices they make- it explores complicated morals and will present you with countless choices, many of which have lasting implications on the realm and the people around you. Every opinion you have, every insult made, can come back to haunt you, or help you, later in the game.\nThere are no punishments or rewards. Just consequences. \nThis game is currently rated M (18+) due to graphic descriptions of violence, heavy and graphic gore, strong language, alcohol usage, sexual content, and heavy topics regarding war.\nTotal Word Count of Demo: 95k words\n\nSynopsis\nThe gods abandoned the realm of Navara long ago— wykna, they were called. With them, they took their magic and their beliefs, leaving the realm to die a slow and pitiful death. Beasts of legend turned to mountains and sea water, living forests turned to graveyards of epic proportions. Without guidance, humans, magic-users, and mythosi were locked in a constant war for the simple right to exist.\nYou were the most feared soldier in all the land— the attack dog of Queen Marcelle and her beloved Kingdom of Plaithus. Your name was known by all— a hero to some, a killer to others. You were a weapon. A beast. Maybe it only made sense that you would snap one day.\n \nOne hundred lives, ten minutes: children, friends, family.\n \nYou don’t know why you did it. Hell— you can’t even remember how you did it. All you have are flickering, waning memories accompanied by an all-consuming guilt and paralyzing paranoia. \n \nYou, my friend, are an exile— and there’s something so very deeply incredibly wrong with you.\n \nGet it out.\n\nCompanions\nVethna Mevnrael (they/them)\nVethna hails from Vygrand-- otherwise known as the sworn rival land of your home country. Where you have been raised to resent most, if not all magic, they have been raised to thrive on it. You don't know much about them-- just that they're on the run from someone, something, powerful, and you're the only one who can protect them. That, and they have a whole lot of gold... almost as much as they have secrets.\nNikke Ivante (he/him)\nNikke has been sent to kill you or kidnap you-- you're not entirely sure which it is, and you don't intend to find out. He's crude and sarcastic and overall a brute. He doesn't seem to take his own life seriously, nonetheless yours, and you have no doubt he's going to capture you or die trying. Hell-- maybe he'll just kill you both while he's at it... you know, for fun.\nJost Ivante (she/her)\nJost is Nikke's identical twin sister-- and, if possible, she's twice as mean and just as rude. She's more ruthless than her brother, but she doesn't quite have the fighting power to back up her venom-laced threats and taunts. Nonetheless, she fights dirty, and if you want to beat her, you're going to have to be smart.\nAmilia Von Clamile (she/her)\nAmilia's a fae-- the very kind of mythosi you've been raised to fear and have spent most of your life killing. She's all smiles and nerves, but you see something else in her eyes, sometimes. Something cold. Something calculative. Everyone seems keen to turn a blind eye to her, but you know a liar when you see one... don't you?\nSabir Du Vaelas (he/him)\nSabir, otherwise known as The Silven Viper, Eye of Plaithus, used to be your charge. He's a politician-- one of the better ones, if such a thing exists. Your past together was volatile-- perhaps you were lovers, or friends, or enemies. Either way, he saved your life when you otherwise would've been put to death by the state, and you owe him thanks for that much.\nSyfyn Javall (she/her)\nSyfyn Javall, The Brazen Griffin, Second-in-Command to the Plaithian Army. She used to work beneath you once-- used to fight beside you and honor you both as a comrade and friend. You grew up together within the military. When you had nobody, you had each other. But then you betrayed her-- or maybe she betrayed you. You don't know who started what, but you do know that the blood is on both of your hands now.\nIt. (she/they/him)\nYou hear its voice sometimes, when it's quiet and you're alone. You try to tune it out. You try to ignore it. It forces you to remember things. To feel things. It's within you, wiggling and writhing, waiting for the right moment to attack. At times it feels predatory. At others, its presence is comforting-- protective and doting. It'll become whatever you want it to be. It'll become whatever you need it to be.\n\nArt Credits: Judie Omais (Tumblr)Patreon: @PheoWritesTumblr: @exilethegame (#exilethegame)"

    "Game Description": "Latest major update: 12/31/23 | Blog link\nTalon's End is a fantasy interactive fiction game about transformation, growth, duty, and love in its many forms. It is written with an adult audience in mind and contains some darker themes, but the demo does not contain any explicit content and should be appropriate for ages 16+. The age rating may change for the full version. Please check CWs when starting the game!\n\nYou were never destined to marry for love.\nAs the third child of the Earl of Eastthorn, your purpose is to marry to your family's advantage, but after one failed engagement already, your prospects are less than promising. So when the Crown calls upon you to infiltrate the lair of an Elven sorcerer in search of a powerful magical weapon, the offer is too good for your family to refuse.\n\nBut leaving your respectable home to marry an immortal being of immense power quickly puts you in uncharted territory. Between your secretive, disagreeable spouse and their labyrinthine spire infested with strange creatures, your mission to uncover their secrets is risky from the start. But as you come to know both your partner and your new home at Talon's End, you discover terrors and wonders unlike anything you've known–and the true price of your mission.\n\nHawk (gender-selectable m/f/nb)\nAncient, inscrutable, and ornery, Hawk is your immortal Elven spouse. They are a being of few words, and those words are often less than friendly. You're taking your life into your hands coming to live in their tower and spy on them. But are they perhaps kinder than they let on? Or are they just as dangerous as they first appear?\nShea (gender-selectable m/f/nb)\nShea is the outgoing and kindhearted owner of the general store in town. Through their regular deliveries to Hawk's tower, they've gotten to know Hawk- -and now, you. They seem eager to make you feel welcome in your new home. But do they have other motives? Or is their compassion genuine?\n\nCurrent demo features:\nPlayer character with customizable gender, pronouns, romantic/physical attraction, etc.\nRelationships with Hawk and Shea can be romantic, platonic, physical, or a combination; plus, a poly triad option!\nOptions to explore the player character's gender and attraction beyond initial choices\nChoice-heavy (not stat-heavy) story with narration that adapts to your MC's personality\nAchievements for doing silly (and cool) things\nUpcoming features:\nOption to bypass mentions of societal bigotry\nAdditional codex and story journal entries\nMore detailed character profiles"

    "Game Title": "Tales of Wocdes: The Silver Protector",
    "Game Description": "Tales of Wocdes: The Silver Protector \nTales of Wocdes: The Silver Protector is a high fantasy interactive fiction made in Twine. During the story, your protagonist will change from a helpless child to a Silver Protector, an elite warrior and protector. In time, you may wield powerful magic, or be a master of the blade.  \nThe game is in early development. All content is subject to change.\nThere is something on tumblr. There is also now a ko-fi page. \nDemo version\nThe current demon contains a prologue (~5500 words) , an interlude (~6000 words) and chapter 1  (~32000 words), a second interlude (~12000 words) and Chapter 2 (~ 48 000 words). The prologue and interlude have a limited amount of choices. Chapter 1 has a lot of choices. The second interlude has no active choices, but is somewhat affected by choices in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 is focused on character customization, and therefore has a lot of choices. \nTotal words ~ 103 500. The word counts include all branches from choices and code inside the text.  Old saved games are not guaranteed to work for new updates. \nBonus content: Tales From the Past (access from the main menu) ~ 22 500 words. \nThere is also something like 25+ k words of snippets on the blog page.  If that is too much scrolling a pdf collection is available through kofi for supporters. \nFeedback for the game\nI would appreciate the reporting of bugs, typos and constructive feedback. The comments should be on on this page, or you can use email: talesofwocdes@gmail.com. Please see the feedback page inside the game for more detail. The option to see it appears at the end of the demo.  \nPremise\nWocdes is a world full of magic, monsters, and secrets. No beings in this world embody all three better than the Ancients,  godlike in power and unbeatable in battle. Incredibly wise and compassionate. Incredibly terrible and cruel. Immortal and glorious. Petty and vengeful. Or so the stories go. \nNot that you know the stories. Why would you? You are a child kidnapped for unknown purposes.  You barely know anything about yourself. Your life is one of pain and suffering at the hands of people you do not know. \nIn a moment of desperation, a plea leaves your lips. Or perhaps it is only in your mind. Unexpectedly something hears you and will never ignore a broken child alone in the dark asking for help. You are saved but you are permanently scarred by your experiences. Given into the care of the newly created Orphanage of Firgrat, here is where your journey truly begins. How will you cope with your past and current reality?  Can you survive the cruel world of Wocdes, the weight of your trauma? Can you help others survive? Can you grow up, make friends, learn to love, and become a real person again?\nWhat to look forward to\nIn this game, you will (eventually) be able to:\nCustomize your character, from their appearance and gender (male, female, non-binary) to their abilities and personality.Admittedly, your characters emotional development has taken a bit of a hit due to recent events, leaving them a bit confused in general about... everything. You can add elements of fantasy races to your character's appearance, such as a tail, wings, pointy ears and many more.\nDiscover why you were kidnapped, eventually.Protect those you feel deserve it, become stronger for yourself or to protect others.Grow up alongside other orphans and kids from the city, journey through childhood at the orphanage and the surrounding city, to adulthood with responsibilities. Develop your relationships with your fellow orphans and other companions, maybe even get into a romance. Speaking of romance, the author aims to offer an option to be completely and utterly dense about romance, like completely oblivious to the degree people worry about you. Or maybe you will be a smoother operator.\nGo on adventures and missions, both innocent and not, in an original fantasy world full of magic, wonder and cruelty.\nCharacters\nPrimary\nThe twins Atru (m) and Azha (f): The original inhabitants of the orphanage and the only children already there when you arrive. Both twins have short blond hair and green eyes. Atru is a seemingly silent emotionless boy who clings to his sister Azha. Azha is a little girl shaped ray of sunshine and well-meaning mischief. And chatter!More characters will be filled out later. A bit more info is available on the blog. \nSecondary\nHavard (m): The head custodian of the Orphanage. A father figure to all the children. His duty is to guide the children, and it is a duty he takes very seriously.Lexia (f): The Silver Protector in charge of you. Young, excitable and strong. One of the first to be chosen for the new elite order called the Silver Protectors.Alessa (f): The custodian in charge of the twins. A sweet young somewhat shy woman who the twins adore, both in their own ways. Sandor (m): The Silver Protector in charge of the twins. A good-natured and somewhat shy young man often trailing after the twins with a fond look. \nThe Ancients\nRAFO (Read And Find Out). You might meet some. \nDisclaimer\nThis is a work of fiction! Any potential resemblance of appearances, names, or personalities of characters with people in real life, living or dead, is coincidental.\nThis story is meant for adults. The game contains depictions of violence, blood, gore, sexually suggestive content, black humor, explicit language etc. A more complete list can be found in game. Like everything else, this list is subject to change. \nThe game contains dealing with traumatic events. The author is not a qualified medical professional, and the in game responses to trauma are not in any way encouraged.  If you are uncomfortable with what you are reading, please refrain from continuing until you feel better. Or drop the story entirely. None of this is worth your health.\nKnown issues \nIt seems that on mobile, the choices at the end of a page will simply not be visible (at least on my phone) if a few empty lines is not left in the Twine file after the choices. I have tried to remember to always do this, but do let me know if there are any instances of this. Spacing between paragraphs needs to be done by hand. Coding counts so if I forget to put in the right commands, the spacing can be off. \n\n"

The theme is “Red Herring”. \nDISCLAIMER\n\nDo not reupload  or redistribute   I’m The Echo When You Call   or any of the assets. Streaming the game is only allowed if commentary is added to it.\n\n\nYou are a Liminari - a scholar who has committed sacrilege by pursuing forbidden knowledge in hopes of evolving into an Old One, a being who can break itself out of the curse of the ouroboros, become a master of its own life and death; a god.\n\nDuring one of your solitary voyages into the Great Nothing, you encounter a rare phenomenon - a dying soul, struggling to rally its last moments. \n\nWill you watch it die, or will you feed it enough of your vitae to see it restored? How will the encounter change you? If at all.\n\nThe plot is told in a series of scenes inspired by diaries or journals that depict an expedition or research of some kind.\nSetting: dark fantasy, romance\nWarning: body horror (mentions of rituals involving blood and mutilation, self-inflicted injuries, human sacrifice. (MC’s current body is that of an undead - details mostly undetermined, up to the player), descriptions of death and violence, religious themes (MC doesn't follow a god, though gods do exist, not as deities that rule over humanity but separate beings (think eldritch horrors style), possible depersonalization and derealization.\n\nRating: 17+\n\nsoon-to-be-god MC (customizable name, pronouns, background), \nan undead (?) companion (gender selectable) who is influenced by your choices and who influences MC’s future in turn,\n 18.000 words in total, approximately half an hour per single playthrough (for the average reader), 6 possible endings.\n\n\nEither foolishly brave or simply desperate, the soul that followed from to the edge of the Great Nothing seems less like a mongrel holding onto its last tread of survival and more like a knowledge-hungry scholar. \nThough (temporarily) lacking a corporeal body, the soul doesn’t lack in personality. The unexpected disruption sure does keep you on your toes, shattering - though not hindering - your pursuit of godhood. \n\nWhy does the soul keep lingering around you, you have no idea... but as anything in the universe, it has to have a reason. At any rate, the insight provided quickly becomes invaluable to your research. Who knows, maybe the last step to breaking the last circle is closer than you think?\nPlaylist [ECHO]\n\nEngine: [Ren'Py by Tom Rothamel]\nWriting, GUI, coding, art: [PDRRook]  \n\n[Twitter] [Tumblr] \nCoding help, version 2.0:  [Dom] \nProofreaders/editors: [Steph 'Jeneara' M]\nBeta players: [berbicacho, Meira, Lily of the Nile]\nFonts, Free for Personal and Commercial Use: \n[Catharsis Requiem]\n[RM Almanack]"

Either out of familial concern or boredom, you embark on a journey from your residence to your sibling's apartment in New Hampshire to see what’s going on and, hopefully, be home before the weekend.\n\nToo bad it’s never so simple.\n\n\nChoose your gender, sexuality, and career choice\nSearch for your missing sibling in an unpredictable world\nDeal with cults, corrupt governments, and superpowered criminals\nCommit a bit of light B&E with your local maximum security facility\nGet a good nights sleep (the most unrealistic part of this game)\nOr, you know, joy ride a Bugatti\n\nPariah [NB] - Your local elusive vigilante who hides behind a mask and a set of sickles. Between spending their nights perched on rooftops, they do enjoy an odd B&E now and then. They also seem to enjoy throwing you into the fray on more than one occasion, much to your chagrin. (Pariah is a canon asexual character, which should be remembered if chosen to romance)\nVasilisa Solovieva [F] - The detective who honestly just wants people to stop fighting. When she isn't solving cold cases, she's trying to make sure you don't die, although the city and its inhabitants seem to be making that quite the task for her.\nOperator [M] - The enigmatic city worker who lives among the decaying buildings of the Under City. Between keeping an eye on all of the cameras and maintaining Attollo's tentative peace agreements, he has his work cut out for him, although he does make efforts to keep you alive as well.\nDreamwalker [M] - The Midnight Man, Mr. Vertigo—he goes by many names, but one thing is the same: he isn't someone you want to cross. As the leader of an ominous organization with a wicked set of powers on top of it all, Dreamwalker seems adamant about Attollo's ruin—and your presence may be creating a bump in his plans.\nSysba/'Ymnar [F, M, or NB] - A disgraced eldritch god with a questionable dietary preference, Sysba has nothing but resentment for the humans they've been trapped with. Despite their allegiance to Ovo, they seem to do just about anything to create chaos. They also seem to know more about what's going on than they care to admit, a fact that may prove deadly down the line.\nSuha Sobhi [F] - A government operative with a stern sense of justice, Suha oversees the legal aspects of Attollo, and her position in the infamous Crowes Court has her as being nearly untouchable in terms of power. Having her assist in finding your sibling may be the break you need—or it could just make things even worse.\n\nPATREON | KO-FI | BLOG\nUI Credit to Nyehilism \nArt credit to Dagnyart"

Congratulations, you’re probably gay and have personal experience in constructing the intricate rituals people won’t shut up about.\nUse Your Outside Voice, Richie Tozier! is a piece of fix-IT fanfiction masquerading under the guise of a game. The story is linear if not self-contained. There is no way to lose. There is, probably, no way to fuck it up.

Let’s try and write something new together.\nCODA/EPILOGUE: https://mapurl.itch.io/let-yourself-out\nContent Warning\nThere are a few minor jump scares in this game, but they are quite literally the exact same ones as in the movie. The game does touch in some capacity on some heavier topics (re: suicide, homophobia), but once again nothing worse than in the movie.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nArrow keys to move. Spacebar to interact.\nLength is approximately one hour. Game should autosave at the beginning of scenes but not at any higher granularity than that. Note that starting a new game will overwrite this save.\nNOTE: If somehow you break the game or it gets stuck, you can exit out of the game and then select “LOAD” from the main menu to restart that scene.

The fix for this differs depending on version, you may have to google around for it.Catalina: youtube.com/watch?v=i9TtoOJjGpU\nFor Chromebook/Linux: PLEASE DO NOT change the resolution (ie fullscreen) the game, this will break it visually. Unfortunately, Linux builds do not let me disable this option.\nIf you are willing to mess around a bit, you should be able to run the linux build of this game on Chromebooks that run on Intel (x86_64) chipsets. This will NOT work on machines that run on ARM chipsets, so please check!\n1) Setup Linux (beta) on your chromebook: https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en\n2) Basically, execute steps A-E from https://itch.io/t/421076/how-to-play-from-chromebook : download the OutsideVoice_Linux.zip file, copy/paste the only folder in it to Linux Files (which should now exist under My Files if you installed the Linux beta). Make sure you wait for the entire folder to finish getting copied before proceeding!\n3) If it didn’t automatically open, open the Linux terminal. You can find it by searching for “linux” or “terminal”. If you’ve never done anything involving the command line interface before, I will do my best to walk you through it.\n4) On the command line, if you type and enter “ls”, the OutsideVoice_Linux folder should appear. “ls” is a command that lists all the contents of a directory.\n5) Type and enter “cd OutsideVoice_Linux”. “cd” is a command that lets you enter a different directory.\n6) Type and enter  “chmod 777 OutsideVoice.x86_64”. “chmod” is a command that changes how a file is registered- in this case, we are telling the system it is something executable.\n7) Type and enter “./OutsideVoice.x86_64”. This should execute the file and open the game.\nPLEASE NOTE that I have not tested this game in its entirety on chromebook.... its still possible (probably) something will break please let me know if it does! "
